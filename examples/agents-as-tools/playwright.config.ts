/**
 * Playwright config for the `agents-as-tools` example.
 *
 * Default mode: boots `vite dev` on port 5173 in the background, points
 * Playwright at it, and runs against a real Workers AI binding (`ai`
 * binding has `remote: true` in `wrangler.jsonc`, so even the dev
 * server hits the real model). Tests are slow but high-fidelity:
 * actual WS frames, actual DO routing, actual LLM tool selection.
 *
 * No CI integration is wired — the user's stated workflow is to run
 * this locally. To run on CI we'd need:
 *   - `playwright install --with-deps chromium`
 *   - A Workers AI auth shape (env var or `wrangler login` + the
 *     account being addressable from CI)
 *   - Whatever flake budget shows up (real LLMs are non-deterministic;
 *     prompts are biased to pick specific tools but a flake-retry
 *     count > 0 will eventually be needed)
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - `workers: 1`. Each test exercises a single Assistant DO that
 *     accumulates state (helper rows, registry rows). Running them
 *     in parallel against the same dev server's DOs would interleave
 *     state in confusing ways. The dev server itself is fine to share;
 *     the cost is throughput, which we trade for clarity.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 *   - Each test gets 90s. Real LLM responses can take 5-30s, and a
 *     test like "research → drill-in → assert side panel renders" can
 *     easily chain three of those.
 *   - Per-action default of 5s is too short for waiting on streamed
 *     content; we override to 30s on the slow assertions.
