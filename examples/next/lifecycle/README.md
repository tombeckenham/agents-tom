# Next: Durable Object lifecycle

An early-access, server-only example showing that `agents/lifecycle` works with
a plain Cloudflare `DurableObject`. It does not extend `Agent` or another SDK
base class.

```ts
export class DoAgent extends DurableObject<Env> {
  private readonly activity = new ActivityCapability(this.ctx.storage);
  private wake: { id: string; startedAt: string } | undefined;
  readonly lifecycle = Lifecycle.install(this).use(this.activity);

  onStart() {
    // Runs once whenever this Durable Object enters memory, including after a
    // hibernating WebSocket wakes a fresh instance.
    this.wake = {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      startedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }

  onRequest() {
    return Response.json({
      name: this.lifecycle.name,
      wake: this.wake,
      activity: this.activity.getActivity()
    });
  }
}
```

The lifecycle starts `ActivityCapability` first, then calls the Durable Object's
`onStart()`. `onStart()` creates a per-wake identifier so HTTP and WebSocket
responses show which in-memory lifetime handled them.

`ActivityCapability` implements `DurableObjectCapability` and contributes
startup, request, and alarm behavior. It also exposes `getActivity()`, its own
ordinary API for reading the durable state it owns. Lifecycle hooks are how a
capability attaches to a host; they are not the limit of its API.

## Run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Exercise the named object `demo`:

```sh
# Host onRequest; also increments the capability's request count.
curl http://localhost:8787/agents/do-agent/demo

# Intercepted by ActivityCapability before the host onRequest.
curl http://localhost:8787/agents/do-agent/demo/stats
```

Connect a WebSocket to `ws://localhost:8787/agents/do-agent/demo`. The object
sends a connection snapshot and echoes each message. The socket uses Cloudflare's
WebSocket Hibernation API, so it remains connected while the Durable Object can
leave memory.

Each normal HTTP request schedules an alarm five seconds later. The capability
records the alarm before the object's `onAlarm` callback runs.
