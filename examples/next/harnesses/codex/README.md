# Codex harness

A Worker-native coding harness that runs a Codex-derived Rust/Wasm turn loop as
a Lifecycle capability inside a plain Durable Object.

The example composes:

- `CodexHarness extends LifecycleCapability` for the durable agent loop;
- `Tasks` for wake delivery and replay;
- `Sessions` for the transcript: every prompt, assistant message, and tool
  output, with compaction;
- `Streams` for ordered operation events;
- `WebSockets` to serve those events to the browser;
- `@cloudflare/shell` Workspace for durable files;
- AI SDK `LanguageModelV4` for model calls;
- `workers-ai-provider` for Kimi K2.7 Code through Workers AI and AI Gateway.

The Wasm kernel is a cursor over one turn: which effect comes next and which
tool calls are pending. Everything with size lives in the SDK's durable
primitives, so nothing here truncates. The transcript is in Sessions, which
chunks large messages across rows; each operation's events go straight to
Streams; model and tool effects are journaled by reference through Tasks
steps; files stay in the Workspace and are read in ranges.

## Model composition

The harness accepts a `LanguageModelV4` directly. It does not parse Workers AI
or OpenAI response envelopes.

```ts
const model = createWorkersAI({
  binding: this.env.AI,
  gateway: { id: "default" }
})("@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code");

readonly codex = new CodexHarness({
  model,
  tasks: this.tasks,
  streams: this.streams,
  sessions: this.sessions,
  workspace: this.workspace
});
```

The Codex codec maps its Responses records to a V4 prompt and maps V4 stream
parts back to Codex records. It preserves every tool call in a model response,
executes the batch sequentially with one durable effect per call, and starts
the next model round only after the complete batch settles.

## Run locally

Install Node 24+, pnpm, and the pinned Rust toolchain with the Wasm target:

```sh
rustup toolchain install 1.95.0 --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
pnpm install
```

Start the Vite app. It builds the Wasm kernel first. The Workers AI binding is
remote, so Wrangler needs a Cloudflare account. If your login has access to
more than one account, set it explicitly:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account id> pnpm run start
```

Open the printed local URL. The chat UI shows reasoning, tool calls, the
persisted Workspace file, kernel timing, and a "Restart and verify" action that
aborts the Durable Object and reloads the operation from durable state.

The browser connects with `useAgent` from `agents/react`. `src/use-codex-session.ts`
layers the harness protocol on that socket: a session snapshot on connect,
`subscribe` to replay-then-tail an operation's `Streams` log, and `submit` and
`restart` to drive it. `harness.webSockets()` returns the options for the
`WebSockets` capability that serves it.

## Storage

| Data                                      | Where                                 | Bound                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Prompts, assistant messages, tool outputs | Sessions                              | Durable Object storage; large messages are chunked  |
| Operation events                          | Streams                               | one stream per operation                            |
| Kernel checkpoint                         | one small row per operation           | a few hundred bytes, independent of transcript size |
| Model and tool effects                    | Tasks step journal                    | message ids only                                    |
| Files                                     | Workspace, spilling to R2 past 1.5 MB | read in ranges with `offset` and `max_bytes`        |

The model's context window is the one real limit, and it is handled in the
prompt rather than in storage. Each round hydrates a byte-budgeted window of
recent history, a tool input or output over 64 KB is replaced in the prompt
by a marker the model can page back with a ranged read, and Sessions
compacts the branch once its estimated tokens pass a threshold, using the
same model to summarise. The budget and the compaction policy are
`CodexHarness` options.

The example binds an R2 bucket named `codex-harness-workspace` for the
Workspace. Create it before deploying:

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket create codex-harness-workspace
```

## Stress test

`src/stress` hosts the same composition with a synthetic model, so the kernel,
Tasks, Streams, and SQLite paths run without Workers AI.

```sh
pnpm run stress:dev            # wrangler dev on :8790, inspector on :9250
pnpm run stress                # or: pnpm run stress deep big-tools concurrent
pnpm run heap snapshot         # V8 heap usage and top holders over CDP
```

## Deploy

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```

## Codex source

The kernel follows `openai/codex` commit
`5e26f7621c1c470fe62350d61c9eb4d6c772a0da`, especially:

- `codex-rs/codex-api/src/common.rs`
- `codex-rs/codex-api/src/sse/responses.rs`
- `codex-rs/protocol/src/models.rs`
- `codex-rs/tools/src/responses_api.rs`
- `codex-rs/tools/src/tool_spec.rs`
- `codex-rs/core/src/session/turn.rs`
- `codex-rs/core/src/tools/parallel.rs`

Codex is Apache-2.0. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
The target design is documented in
[`design/rfc-codex-harness-capability.md`](../../../design/rfc-codex-harness-capability.md).
