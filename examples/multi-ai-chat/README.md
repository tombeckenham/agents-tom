# Multi AI Chat

Multi-session AI chat built on the sub-agent routing primitive. A
single `Inbox` Durable Object owns the chat list + per-user shared
memory; each chat is a **facet** of that inbox — its own
`AIChatAgent` DO, colocated on the same machine, with isolated
SQLite storage. Chat facets can use the normal Agents scheduling and
durable-execution APIs; the parent owns the physical alarm, but
callbacks and recovery run inside the chat facet.

This is the pattern the proposed `Chats` base class in
[`design/rfc-think-multi-session.md`](../../design/rfc-think-multi-session.md)
will codify as sugar. When that RFC lands, most of `Inbox` becomes
`extends Chats<Env>` and the client-side wiring collapses to a
single `useChats()` hook — but the mechanics underneath are already
shipped and demonstrated here.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open the dev URL. Click **New** to create a chat. Start chatting.

The assistant has four tools it can choose to call during a turn:

- `rememberFact(fact)` — saves a fact to the user's shared memory
  (persisted on the parent `Inbox`, visible to every chat on the
  next turn). Try: _"Remember I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript."_
- `recallMemory()` — reads the full shared memory.
- `getCurrentTime()` — returns the server's current ISO time.
- `askResearcher(topic)` — delegates a focused question to a nested
  `Researcher` sub-agent under the current `Chat`. Try: _"Ask the
  researcher to summarize the tradeoffs in this conversation."_

Each tool call renders in-line as a collapsible panel with state,
input, and output; reasoning traces (if the model emits any) show
up as dimmed "Thinking" blocks. Text, reasoning, and tool parts
stream in order as the model produces them.

You can also type a fact in **Shared memory** at the bottom of the
sidebar and hit **Save memory** to set it manually — useful when
you want to seed the assistant with context without a tool call.

URL shapes the client connects to:

- `/agents/inbox/demo-user` — the sidebar / Inbox RPC surface.
- `/agents/inbox/demo-user/sub/chat/{chatId}` — a specific chat. The
  Inbox parent gatekeeps via `onBeforeSubAgent`, then the WebSocket
  is upgraded straight to the `Chat` facet.

Key things worth looking at in `src/server.ts`:

- `Inbox.onBeforeSubAgent` — a strict-registry gate. A chat becomes
  reachable only after `createChat` has called `this.subAgent(Chat, id)`
  once. `hasSubAgent` reads the framework-maintained registry that
  `subAgent` / `deleteSubAgent` populate. Unknown chat ids get a 404
  before any facet is woken.
- `Inbox._refreshState` reads the chat list from
  `listSubAgents(Chat)` (the framework-owned registry) and joins in
  app-owned metadata (title, preview) from a tiny `chat_meta` table.
  Existence lives with the framework; decoration lives with the app.
- `Inbox.createChat` / `deleteChat` are thin wrappers over
  `this.subAgent(Chat, id)` / `this.deleteSubAgent(Chat, id)` that
  insert / remove the matching meta row.
- `Chat.getInbox()` uses the framework's `parentAgent(Inbox)`
  helper — pass the parent's class, get back a typed parent stub
  with the right identity baked in. No hardcoded user id, no
  `getAgentByName` plumbing inside the facet.
- `Chat` can spawn a nested `Researcher` helper with
  `this.subAgent(Researcher, "default")`. The helper calls
  `this.parentAgent(Chat)` to get context from its direct parent even
  though `Chat` is itself a facet rather than a top-level binding.
- Each `Chat` owns its own SQLite database, stream state, and recovery
  state. `AIChatAgent` client streams resume on reconnect by default. If you
  want Durable Object eviction recovery for each chat facet, opt in with
  `override chatRecovery = true` on the `Chat` class. If you build this pattern
  with `Think`, `chatRecovery` is already enabled by default. In both cases the
  root parent's alarm drives recovery checks back into idle children, and
  reconnecting to the `/sub/chat/{chatId}` URL attaches directly to that child.
- The worker entry is a one-liner: `routeAgentRequest(request, env)`.
  It already knows how to walk `/agents/inbox/.../sub/chat/...` — no
  custom routing needed.

And in `src/client.tsx`:

- The sidebar connection:
  `useAgent({ agent: "Inbox", name: DEMO_USER })`.
- The active chat connection:
  `useAgent({ agent: "Inbox", name: DEMO_USER, sub: [{ agent: "Chat", name: chatId }] })`.
  The `sub` array builds the nested URL; `useAgentChat` wraps the
  resulting socket unchanged.

## Why this shape

- **One Durable Object per chat** means two chats for the same user
  run in parallel. If all chats lived inside a single DO (a "session
  map" pattern), inference would serialize — DOs are single-threaded.
- **The Inbox keeps a single source of truth.** Chat creation,
  deletion, and shared memory all go through the parent. The registry
  - `hasSubAgent` gate prevents orphaned chats from accidentally
    being woken by speculative client requests.
- **`parentPath` replaces hardcoded parent lookups.** A child Chat
  doesn't need to know the user id — it knows its parent from the
  chain the framework gave it at facet-init time.
- **Shared memory lives on the parent, not inside each chat.** This
  is what makes "facts the assistant learns about you" persist across
  chats. A more ambitious app could bump this up to Session context
  blocks + search (see `Think` + the `RemoteContextProvider` proposal).

## Notes / limits

- Single-user demo — the Inbox name is hardcoded to `demo-user`. In a
  real app, authenticate first and use the user's id.
- Titles default to `Chat — YYYY-MM-DD`. LLM-generated titles are
  intentionally out of scope for the example.
- `onBeforeSubAgent` uses a permissive-by-default sketch: if you want
  to allow lazy chat creation on first connect (no explicit
  `createChat` step), drop the `hasSubAgent` check — the framework
  will call `subAgent()` as part of dispatch.
