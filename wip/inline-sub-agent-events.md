# Inline sub-agent event streaming — design notes

## Non-blocking follow-up work

The shipped framework feature is **agent tools**: `runAgentTool(Cls,
options)`, `agentTool(Cls, options)`, `agent-tool-event` frames,
parent-side run retention in `cf_agent_tool_runs`, Think and
AIChatAgent child adapters, and `useAgentToolEvents`.

The items below are the remaining non-blocking work. They are not required
for the current feature to ship, but this is the best place to resume if
someone wants to deepen the capability.

1. **Browser-provided client tools in AIChatAgent child runs.**
   AIChatAgent can now run headlessly as an agent-tool child. Server-side
   tools work because they live in the child DO, but browser-provided
   client tools do not: the child turn has no browser WebSocket and no
   client tool executor. A likely design is a parent-mediated bridge where
   the child emits a client-tool request, the parent forwards it over the
   parent chat connection, and the result is routed back to the child run.
   Start from `packages/ai-chat/src/index.ts`'s agent-tool adapter and the
   issue filed for this limitation.

2. **Live-tail reattachment / persistent helper semantics.**
   Today a parent that loses its forwarding loop marks an in-flight
   agent-tool run `interrupted`. Stored chunks can replay, but the parent
   does not reattach to an already-running child tail or harvest the
   child's eventual terminal result. Solving this needs a "subscribe to
   existing tail" policy plus a result handoff from child to parent after
   parent recovery. Start from `Agent.runAgentTool()`,
   `_forwardAgentToolStream()`, `AgentToolChildAdapter.tailAgentToolRun()`,
   and the child-side `inspectAgentToolRun()` methods.

3. **Recursive agent-tool UI.**
   Agent-tool children are real agents, so a child can theoretically call
   its own agent tools. The reference UI only renders one drill-in level.
   A production recursive UI would need a stack/tree model for nested
   agent-tool panels, clear scoping for `parentToolCallId`, and UX around
   moving between parent, child, and grandchild timelines. Start from
   `examples/agents-as-tools/src/client.tsx` and `useAgentToolEvents`.

4. **Retention / GC policy for retained runs.**
   Completed runs are retained until explicit cleanup such as
   `clearAgentToolRuns()`. Production apps may want age, count, branch, or
   chat-message-linked retention so child DOs and parent registry rows do
   not grow indefinitely. Start from `cf_agent_tool_runs`,
   `hasAgentToolRun()`, `clearAgentToolRuns()`, and the example's Clear
   behavior.

5. **Production UI, accessibility, and real-LLM CI polish.**
   The example is a reference demo, not a polished product surface. Modal
   focus trapping, `aria-modal` behavior, richer loading/error states, and
   CI wiring for the real-LLM Playwright suite are still open. Start from
   `examples/agents-as-tools/e2e/` and the drill-in panel implementation.

Do **not** revive the multi-channel `ResumableStream` plan from the older
sections of this note for agent tools. The winning design gives each child
agent its own Durable Object and SQLite database, so same-DO stream table
collisions are avoided by construction.

## Why this doc exists

Issue [#1377](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1377)
("`ResumableStream` is hardcoded to chat use case") looks on its surface
like a small library cleanup: two literals in one file, two optional
constructor arguments, ~20-line patch. Defaults preserve back-compat,
non-chat callers pass distinct values, ship.

Reading carefully, the issue is the visible tip of a much bigger missing
piece: **first-class sub-agents that participate inside a single chat
turn, with their lifecycle events streaming back into that turn's UI in
real time.** The OP hit `ResumableStream`'s hardcoding because it is the
nearest piece of generic-shaped infra in the framework, and the
"durably stream chunks over WS, with replay on reconnect" abstraction is
what anyone building this pattern would reach for first.

This note captures:

- what the OP is actually building (in plain language)
- the gap between what we ship as "sub-agents" today and what the OP
  needs
- why the two-line fix from #1377 is correct but insufficient
- the full design surface, in concentric rings
- a concrete staged plan that ships the cheap fix now without
  prejudicing the larger design
- the open questions that the larger design has to answer

It is intentionally provisional. The smallest part — the durable
streaming primitive — was explored here but intentionally not generalized
for agent tools. Everything above it became a real design problem and
eventually graduated into the RFC and framework implementation described
below.

## Current outcome — snapshot 2026-04-30

This WIP note has mostly served its purpose. The pattern explored here
graduated into the accepted RFC
`design/rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md`, the stable design record
`design/agent-tools.md`, user docs in `docs/agents/agent-tools.md`, and a
framework implementation under the public **agent tools** name.

**What is done:**

- Stage 1 (`messageType` / `tablePrefix` options on `ResumableStream`):
  **intentionally not shipped.** The winning design gives each child
  agent its own Durable Object and SQLite database, so same-DO stream
  table collisions do not occur. Parent-visible progress is sent as
  `agent-tool-event` frames, not as a second `ResumableStream` channel
  on the parent socket.
- Stage 2 (`examples/agents-as-tools`): **done and rewritten.** The
  original hand-rolled `helper-event` prototype was replaced with the
  framework APIs. The example now uses `agentTool(Researcher, ...)`,
  `agentTool(Planner, ...)`, `this.runAgentTool(...)` for `compare`
  fan-out, and `useAgentToolEvents({ agent })` on the client.
- Stage 3 (RFC): **done.** The accepted RFC is
  `design/rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md`.
- Stage 4 (framework implementation): **done for Think-based and
  AIChatAgent-based agent tools.** The shipped surface is
  `runAgentTool(Cls, options)`,
  `agentTool(Cls, options)`, the `agent-tool-event` protocol,
  parent-side `cf_agent_tool_runs`, Think and AIChatAgent child adapter
  methods, and the React `useAgentToolEvents` hook.
- Docs / release notes: **done.** See `docs/agents/agent-tools.md`,
  `design/agent-tools.md`, `packages/think/README.md`,
  `packages/ai-chat/README.md`, and the changeset.

**What is not done, by design:**

See "Non-blocking follow-up work" at the top of this file. The remaining
items are intentionally outside the shipped framework feature.

**How to verify the shipped state:**

- `npm test --workspace @cloudflare/agents-agents-as-tools-example`
- `npx tsc -p examples/agents-as-tools/tsconfig.json --noEmit`
- `npm run check`

The rest of this file is retained as historical context: it records how
the design moved from "inline helper events" and a prototype
`HelperAgent` toward the final `agent tools` API.

## Terminology — "sub-agent" is overloaded

The same word means two different things in this repo and being
sloppy about it has been a source of confusion:

1. **Sub-agent as nested addressable Durable Object** (what we ship).
   Documented in `docs/agents/sub-agents.md`:

   > Sub-agents are child Durable Objects colocated under a parent
   > agent. Each sub-agent has its own isolated SQLite storage and its
   > own WebSocket connections … Clients reach a sub-agent directly
   > via a nested URL.

   API surface: `subAgent(Cls, name)`, `parentAgent(Cls)`,
   `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`, `onBeforeSubAgent`, `hasSubAgent`,
   `listSubAgents`. URL shape: `/agents/inbox/<userId>/sub/chat/<chatId>`.
   The browser picks one and connects directly to it.

   Suggested use cases (verbatim from the doc): "chats, documents,
   sessions, shards, projects" — i.e. **siblings the user navigates
   between**, each with their own UI. `examples/multi-ai-chat` and
   `examples/assistant` are the canonical demonstrations.

2. **Sub-agent as turn-scoped helper** (now shipped as **agent
   tools** for Think and AIChatAgent child agents). The Claude Code / Cursor /
   Devin pattern: you're in one chat, the assistant decides to dispatch
   helper agents to do tool work in parallel, and their lifecycle
   events — started, streamed chunks, finished/error — stream back
   into the **same** chat's UI as the turn unfolds.

The two are different in almost every important dimension:

|                     | Nested addressable (shipped)  | Agent tools (shipped)                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Lifetime            | Long-lived (a whole chat)     | Retained per run until cleanup        |
| WS termination      | At the child                  | At the parent, with child drill-in    |
| User picks one?     | Yes (sidebar / URL)           | No (parent dispatches)                |
| Identity in UI      | Top-level conversation        | Inline part of the parent message     |
| Number active       | One at a time per browser tab | Many in parallel per turn             |
| Event surface       | Whatever the child broadcasts | `agent-tool-event` lifecycle/chunks   |
| Replay on reconnect | Single chat stream            | Parent registry + child stream replay |

When the OP says "sub-agent event streaming on a Think-based DO," they
mean sense (2). When the framework documentation says "sub-agent," it
usually means sense (1). The routing primitive is necessary for agent
tools because children still want to be addressable Durable Objects with
their own state — but it is not sufficient, because agent tools also need
the parent DO to multiplex child events onto its own WebSocket.

Throughout the historical sections below, "helper" = sense (2),
"sub-agent (routing)" = sense (1). The final public name for sense (2)
is **agent tools**.

## What the OP is actually trying to do

Stripped of framework language:

> I'm building an agent where, when you chat with it, behind the
> scenes it spawns helper agents (other agents doing tool work) and I
> want those helpers' progress events to stream back into the browser
> UI in real time.

The browser has one WebSocket open to the parent. So both:

1. the normal chat reply stream from the LLM, and
2. the helper event stream

have to flow over that same socket, from that same Durable Object.

The OP wanted to reuse `ResumableStream` for (2) because it already
solves their hard problem: refresh the page mid-turn → you should see
helper progress catch up, not vanish. Helper events, like LLM tokens,
need durable buffering and replay-on-reconnect.

That's what the issue body actually says, just phrased as a complaint
about hardcoded literals. The literals are blocking the OP from
running a second `ResumableStream` instance on the same DO for helper
events. They worked around it by hand-rolling parallel SQL + replay
plumbing, reinventing `ResumableStream`'s batched writes, row-size
guard, and stale-stream cleanup in the process.

## Current state of `ResumableStream`

Last touched in [#1237](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1237)
(the chat-shared-layer extract). Untouched since then despite a flurry
of adjacent activity (see "Why recent work doesn't address this" below).
The hardcoded literals from the issue are present verbatim.

The two collisions:

1. **SQL tables are hardcoded.** `cf_ai_chat_stream_chunks` and
   `cf_ai_chat_stream_metadata` appear as literal strings in 24
   places across the file (table creation, all CRUD, `restore()`,
   `clearAll()`, `destroy()`, `_maybeCleanupOldStreams`). Two
   instances on the same `this.sql` would interleave their rows,
   `restore()` would pick up whichever instance happened to have the
   most recent `status='streaming'` row, and `clearAll()` from one
   would wipe the other.

   ```86:103:packages/agents/src/chat/resumable-stream.ts
       this.sql`create table if not exists cf_ai_chat_stream_chunks (
         id text primary key,
         stream_id text not null,
         body text not null,
         chunk_index integer not null,
         created_at integer not null
       )`;

       this.sql`create table if not exists cf_ai_chat_stream_metadata (
         id text primary key,
         request_id text not null,
         status text not null,
         created_at integer not null,
         completed_at integer
       )`;
   ```

2. **Replay wire type is hardcoded.** All four `connection.send()`
   calls inside `replayChunks` stamp every frame with
   `type: CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE`. The browser's chat
   hook listens on that exact tag and tries to decode the body as
   chat content — so a non-chat consumer sharing the same WS would
   collide on the client side too.

   ```297:307:packages/agents/src/chat/resumable-stream.ts
       for (const chunk of chunks || []) {
         connection.send(
           JSON.stringify({
             body: chunk.body,
             done: false,
             id: requestId,
             type: CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE,
             replay: true
           })
         );
       }
   ```

The constructor takes only `sql`:

```84:107:packages/agents/src/chat/resumable-stream.ts
  constructor(private sql: SqlTaggedTemplate) {
    // Create tables for stream chunks and metadata
    this.sql`create table if not exists cf_ai_chat_stream_chunks (
```

So the OP's diagnosis holds in code, today.

## Why recent work doesn't address this

Several PRs in the last week landed work _adjacent_ to resumable
streaming. None of them touched `resumable-stream.ts`:

- **[#1374](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1374)** —
  "resume-stream stability fixes." Sounds related; isn't quite. It
  fixed Think's `onConnect` broadcasting `CHAT_MESSAGES` mid-stream
  (which was overwriting the in-progress assistant message after a
  refresh). Side benefit: `_resumableStream` was promoted from
  `private` to `protected` on both `AIChatAgent` and Think. That
  helps subclasses _coordinate around_ the resume lifecycle, but
  even a subclass instantiating a second `ResumableStream` still
  collides on the literal table names and frame type. Visibility
  was the wrong axis.
- **[#1384](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1384)** —
  multi-session assistant. Settled that one chat conversation lives
  in one child DO, browser connects directly to the child via
  `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`. In that pattern the parent DO doesn't
  run a Think chat at all, so the collision the OP describes doesn't
  arise _for that architecture_. But the OP's architecture is
  exactly the opposite — the parent terminates the WS _because_ it
  needs to multiplex helper events into the user's only chat thread.
  #1384 is "you don't need to do that," not "we made that work."
- **[#1393](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1393)** —
  facet bootstrap via explicit `FacetStartupOptions.id`. Unrelated.
- **[#1394](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1394)** —
  Think `beforeStep` hook + `TurnConfig.output` passthrough.
  Unrelated.
- **[#1395](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1395)** —
  `SubmitConcurrencyController` lifted into `agents/chat`. Doesn't
  touch the stream class.
- **[#1396](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1396)** —
  `message-reconciler.ts` moved into `agents/chat`. Doesn't touch
  the stream class.

The post-#1384 chat-shared-layer growth pattern (PRs #1393–#1396)
is consistent with what one would expect: each cross-cutting fix
that _both_ AIChatAgent and Think need migrates from `ai-chat` into
`agents/chat`. Helper streaming is the next obvious thing for that
layer to absorb, and `ResumableStream` is already living in
`agents/chat` waiting for its second consumer.

## What's shipped vs unshipped

Historical note: the list below was the gap analysis before the
2026-04-30 framework implementation. It is kept to explain why this work
was needed, but several bullets that were originally "unshipped" are now
covered by agent tools.

**Shipped:**

- Routing primitive: `subAgent(Cls, name)`, `parentAgent(Cls)`,
  `onBeforeSubAgent`, `hasSubAgent`, `listSubAgents`,
  `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`. Documented in `docs/agents/sub-agents.md`.
- Resumable streaming for the parent's _own_ chat reply, durable
  across reconnect / hibernation. One `ResumableStream` per Think
  / AIChatAgent DO.
- Per-DO SQLite, isolated in colocated facets.
- Multi-session assistant pattern (sense (1)) — kitchen-sink
  reference in `examples/assistant`, minimal proof in
  `examples/multi-ai-chat`.
- Agent tools (sense (2), originally Think-first and now also
  AIChatAgent-capable): `runAgentTool`, `agentTool`,
  `agent-tool-event`, `useAgentToolEvents`, parent run retention,
  reconnect replay, cancellation, cleanup, and drill-in gating.

**Still unshipped / intentionally deferred:**

- Browser-provided client tools in AIChatAgent child runs.
- Live-tail reattachment and persistent helper semantics after parent
  crash.
- Recursive agent-tool UI and production UI polish.
- Quota/retention policy beyond explicit `clearAgentToolRuns()` and
  caller-provided cleanup.

## What the small fix from #1377 buys us

The OP proposed two optional constructor arguments, both back-compat:

```ts
class ResumableStream {
  constructor(
    sql: SqlTaggedTemplate,
    options?: { tablePrefix?: string; messageType?: string }
  );
}
```

- `tablePrefix` defaults to `"cf_ai_chat_"`.
- `messageType` defaults to `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE`.

Existing chat callers preserve byte-identical behavior. A second
instance on the same DO can pick a non-colliding prefix and a
non-colliding message type and coexist with the first.

This would have been the minimum legal repair, but the later design
pivot made it unnecessary for agent tools. It is correct for a different
problem — multiple independent durable streams inside the same DO — but
on its own it leaves the actual feature ("helper events streaming into a
turn") entirely DIY for every consumer, who would each independently
have to:

- pick a table prefix and a wire-type tag
- wire up start/append/complete on the parent DO
- design their own helper event schema
- teach their client code to demux the second wire type
- handle cancellation / cleanup / retention by hand
- reinvent the integration with `useAgentChat`'s message lifecycle

i.e. the value-add is approximately "you can now pay all the same
costs the OP paid, without colliding with the chat tables." That's
genuinely useful as an unblock, and it leaves enough room above it
to do the design properly. But it isn't the design.

## Design pivot: helpers-as-sub-agents with parent-forwarding (2026-04-27)

The original design captured below (multi-channel `ResumableStream`
on the parent DO, helpers reporting events back into a parent-owned
channel) was the obvious "fix #1377 cleanly" path. After working
through it concretely, including building `examples/agents-as-tools`
v0 and stepping back to compare alternatives, we landed on a
different design that's a better foundation for everything above
the streaming primitive.

**The pivot:** helpers are real sub-agents (each its own DO with
its own `ResumableStream`), the browser keeps one WebSocket to
whatever DO it normally connects to, and the **parent forwards**
helper events from the helper's stream onto its own WS while a tool
execute is in flight. The parent maintains a tiny `active_helpers`
table so it can replay each in-flight helper's stored events on
reconnect.

What this changes vs. the original "multi-channel on parent" plan:

|                          | Original (multi-channel)                | Pivot (helpers as sub-agents + forward) |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Helper state location    | Parent DO                               | **Helper's own DO**                     |
| Browser WSes per session | 1                                       | 1                                       |
| Drill-in detail view     | Needs new API on parent                 | **Free — routing primitive**            |
| `ResumableStream` shape  | Multi-channel, schema migration         | **Single-channel, one ctor option**     |
| Persistent helpers later | Needs new TTL machinery on parent       | **Free — helpers outlive the run**      |
| Parallel helpers         | All write back through parent's isolate | **Each helper writes locally**          |
| Tables on parent         | `chat` + `helper-events` channels       | Just `chat` (unchanged)                 |
| Replay-on-reconnect      | Trivial (parent has all state)          | One extra step (parent re-fetches)      |

Cost: a small reconnect-replay step on the parent (track active
helpers, on reconnect query each helper's stored events and forward
to the connecting client). Live event flow continues through
`broadcast()` while the tool execute is running.

The decisive points:

1. **State containment.** A helper's events are about the helper's
   work, not the chat's. Putting them on the helper's DO is the
   honest representation. Persistent / inspectable / drill-in-able
   helpers are a natural extension; they aren't with parent-side
   storage.
2. **Reuses the routing primitive instead of inventing.** Drill-in,
   addressing, lifecycle, parent/child RPC — all already shipped.
   The helper inherits all of that for free.
3. **Smaller framework change.** One ctor option (`messageType`)
   instead of multi-channel schema + per-channel state machine.
   Tables don't need to be parameterized because each DO has its
   own SQLite — collisions are impossible by isolation, not by
   prefix.
4. **Multi-ai-chat-compatible.** The pattern is recursive: the WS
   terminus may be a top-level agent (agents-as-tools) or itself a
   sub-agent (multi-ai-chat's `Chat` is a child of `Inbox`). In
   either case, helpers are children of whoever terminates the WS,
   and the same forwarding pattern applies.

What gets parked: **the multi-channel `ResumableStream` design**.
This remains as historical design context only. For helpers specifically,
it's the wrong tool, and it should not be treated as a follow-up to agent
tools without a fresh RFC and a separate motivating use case.

What this means for the rings:

- **Ring 1** shrinks from "multi-channel `ResumableStream`" to "add
  `messageType` ctor option to `ResumableStream`" (~10 LOC).
- **Ring 4** ("client rendering / drill-in") moves from "future,
  optional" to "central, free via the existing routing primitive."
- **Ring 3** (parent-side API) gets simpler — `helperTool(Cls)` is
  now sugar over `subAgent` + `startAndStream` + `broadcast`.
- **Rings 2, 5, 6** unchanged in spirit, simpler in mechanics.

The "concentric rings" section below is preserved as a record of
the original design space we explored. The Stage 1 / Stage 2 plans
later in the doc are the ones that reflect the pivot.

## The full design surface, in concentric rings

Six rings. Each adds capability over the one below. Ring 1 is the
plumbing; Rings 2–4 are the helper protocol; Rings 5–6 are the
finishing touches.

### Ring 1 — multi-channel durable streaming primitive

What `ResumableStream` is _trying_ to be and isn't quite.

Not the OP's two ctor args verbatim. The cleaner generalization:
**one DO, N named channels.**

API sketch:

```ts
class DurableStreamChannels {
  constructor(
    sql: SqlTaggedTemplate,
    options?: {
      tablePrefix?: string; // defaults to "cf_durable_stream_"
    }
  );

  // start a new stream on a named channel
  start(channelId: string, requestId?: string): string;

  // append to a stream
  storeChunk(channelId: string, streamId: string, body: string): void;

  // complete or error a stream
  complete(channelId: string, streamId: string): void;
  markError(channelId: string, streamId: string): void;

  // replay all active streams on a connection, optionally filtered
  // by channel subscription
  replayChunks(
    connection: Connection,
    options?: {
      channels?: string[]; // default: all
      formatFrame?: (chunk: {
        channelId: string;
        streamId: string;
        body: string;
        done: boolean;
        replay: true;
        replayComplete?: true;
      }) => string; // default: chat-format
    }
  ): Array<{ channelId: string; streamId: string }>;

  // restore on hibernation wake
  restore(): Array<{ channelId: string; streamId: string; requestId: string }>;

  hasActiveStream(channelId: string): boolean;
}
```

Implementation notes:

- One row-space, namespaced by `channel_id` column. No more two
  hardcoded table names. SQL queries gain a `channel_id = ?`
  predicate.
- `formatFrame` parameterizes the wire type tag plus any other
  envelope shape the channel needs. Chat callers pass a closure
  that produces today's `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE`
  envelope. Helper callers pass a closure that produces a
  `helper-event` envelope.
- The `chat` channel keeps the literal name `"chat"` and the
  default `tablePrefix` choice migrates the existing chat tables
  via a one-time rename or a `union all` reader for transition
  (tractable; details TBD). Acceptable to skip migration if we
  bump the framework major.
- Deletes (`clearAll`, `destroy`) take an optional channel filter.
  Default = all channels for back-compat.
- `restore()` returns _all_ active streams, not just the most
  recent — the existing implementation's "pick the most recent
  streaming row" behavior was always a code smell, defensible only
  because there could only be one.

Naming: `DurableStreamChannels` is awkward. `MultiChannelStream`?
`StreamChannels`? `ResumableStreamChannels`? Bikeshed later.
For internal back-compat, keep a thin `ResumableStream` shim that
wraps a single-channel `chat` and preserves today's API shape.

This ring is _small_ and _cheap_. Maybe a day of focused work.
Crucially, **it's the same shape regardless of what we decide for
Rings 2–6**. Whatever helper protocol we ship, the underlying
durable storage layer is multi-channel by `channel_id`. So we can
ship Ring 1 today and not regret it.

### Ring 2 — helper event vocabulary

What does a helper actually _emit_?

Two real options:

**Option A: reuse AI SDK `UIMessagePart` with a helper namespace.**

Each helper event is an existing `UIMessagePart` plus a `helperId`
discriminator. Lifecycle events become a small set of additional
parts: `helper-started`, `helper-finished`, `helper-error`. The
common message-part renderers in the React layer get most helpers
"for free."

Pros: minimal new vocabulary, immediate compatibility with anything
that already renders message parts, helpers feel like inline
mini-conversations (because they are).

Cons: not all helpers are LLM helpers — pure code task helpers
(e.g. "run this build, stream stdout") don't naturally produce
text-deltas or tool-calls. Forces those into `helper-progress`-shaped
parts.

**Option B: define a separate event vocabulary.**

Lifecycle events plus arbitrary `state` / `progress` blobs:

```ts
type HelperEvent =
  | {
      kind: "started";
      helperId: string;
      parentTurnId: string;
      type: string;
      input: unknown;
    }
  | {
      kind: "progress";
      helperId: string;
      message?: string;
      percent?: number;
      data?: unknown;
    }
  | {
      kind: "tool-call";
      helperId: string;
      toolCallId: string;
      toolName: string;
      input: unknown;
    }
  | {
      kind: "tool-result";
      helperId: string;
      toolCallId: string;
      output: unknown;
    }
  | { kind: "text-delta"; helperId: string; messageId: string; delta: string }
  | { kind: "finished"; helperId: string; result: unknown }
  | {
      kind: "error";
      helperId: string;
      error: { name: string; message: string; cause?: unknown };
    };
```

Pros: cleaner separation, accommodates non-LLM helpers naturally,
forces the client into an explicit demux step.

Cons: parallel vocabulary to AI SDK's UIMessagePart; renderers have
to be written or wrapped.

**Provisional answer: a hybrid.** Lifecycle events
(`started`, `finished`, `error`) plus a `parts` channel that carries
`UIMessagePart` items the helper produced. The lifecycle wrapper is
generic; the `parts` channel naturally supports both LLM and non-LLM
helpers (the latter just doesn't emit any).

### Ring 3 — parent-side API: `runHelper`

How does the parent's turn code launch a helper and get its events
plumbed into the turn?

Two real shapes, possibly both:

**Shape 1: explicit handle.**

```ts
const helper = await this.runHelper(ResearchAgent, {
  input: { query },
  parentTurnId: ctx.turnId
});

for await (const event of helper.events) {
  // events automatically also written to the durable channel for
  // this turn — for-await is a passive observer
}

const result = await helper.result;
```

The framework:

- spawns / reuses the helper sub-agent (same DO under the parent)
- starts a durable channel keyed by `(parentTurnId, helperId)`
- subscribes to the helper's event stream and writes each event
  through the channel (broadcast + persist + replay-on-reconnect)
- awaits the helper's return value as `helper.result`
- on parent turn abort, signals the helper

The for-await loop is _optional_ — if the parent only wants the
final return value, the events still flow to the browser
automatically.

**Shape 2: helper-as-AI-SDK-tool.**

```ts
tools: {
  research: helperTool(ResearchAgent),
  buildAndTest: helperTool(BuildAgent),
}
```

`helperTool(Cls)` returns an AI SDK tool whose `execute` runs the
helper end-to-end. The framework intercepts and pipes the helper's
events into the live stream while the tool is "executing." From
the LLM's perspective this is a normal tool call with an input
schema and a single output. From the user's perspective they see
rich live progress alongside the assistant message.

This is the Cursor "background agents" / Claude Code sub-agent
pattern. Almost certainly what most consumers actually want — they
let the LLM decide _when_ to dispatch helpers, just by exposing
them as tools.

We probably want **both**. Shape 2 is the high-level convenience;
Shape 1 is the escape hatch when the parent has its own logic
about when to dispatch helpers (cron-driven, condition-driven,
retry-driven).

### Ring 4 — client rendering

`useAgentChat` returns `messages: UIMessage[]`. Where do helper
events go?

**Option A: a new message part type.**

```ts
type HelperMessagePart = {
  type: "helper";
  helperId: string;
  status: "running" | "succeeded" | "failed";
  parts: UIMessagePart[]; // events the helper produced
  result?: unknown;
};
```

Attached to whichever assistant message dispatched the helper.
Composes with everything that already renders `UIMessage.parts`.
Replay falls out for free because parts are already replayable.

**Option B: parallel stream.**

`useAgentChat` returns `messages` plus `helpers: HelperState[]`,
keyed by helperId, with their own event log. The UI weaves them
back into the message stream itself.

Decoupled, but harder to reason about ordering — when in the
assistant's text did this helper start? In Option A that's
implicit in part order.

**Provisional answer: Option A.** Helper rendering becomes a
compound part renderer — given a `helper` part, render the
lifecycle plus its inner `parts` array via the same renderer
recursively. Common patterns ("collapsed by default, expand to see
detail") become CSS.

There's also a **drill-in question**: should a helper be addressable
as a separate UI surface, like Claude Code's panes?

If yes, helpers have stable sub-agent names and the standard routing
primitive Just Works for a detail view:

```tsx
const helperDetail = useAgent({
  agent: "MyAssistant",
  name: chatId,
  sub: [{ agent: "ResearchAgent", name: helperId }]
});
```

That's _free_ — we already shipped it. The inline-events view and
the detail view are the same DO viewed two different ways. Worth
preserving as an option from day one even if the inline view is
the default.

### Ring 5 — lifecycle, cancellation, persistence

The genuinely hard stuff. Each of these is a real design question:

- **Lifetime.** Per-turn (helper aborts when the turn ends) or
  persistent (helper outlives the turn, can be checked on later)?
  Different defaults make sense for different use cases. Probably:
  configurable per helper class, default per-turn.
- **Cancellation.** Three orthogonal signals:
  1. Parent turn aborted → all helpers should cancel.
  2. User cancels one helper → turn continues, that branch fails.
  3. Helper crashes / returns error → does the LLM see an error
     tool-result, or does the whole turn fail?
     Need explicit propagation. AI SDK `AbortSignal` doesn't cross DO
     RPC by default; we'd plumb cancellation via an `abortSubAgent`
     call (already shipped) keyed by helper run ID.
- **Concurrency.** N parallel helpers in one turn. Their events
  interleave on the WS. The channel ID (Ring 1) gives the client
  enough info to demux; the message-part wrapper (Ring 4 Option A)
  groups them by which assistant message dispatched them.
- **Retention.** Finished helpers' event logs need cleanup. Tied
  to turn retention? Independent? Probably: helper retention follows
  the parent turn's retention. Helpers running when the parent turn
  is deleted get aborted.
- **Auth / quota.** Helpers inherit the parent's auth context.
  Helper LLM tokens count against the parent user's quota. Both
  need to be wired explicitly — the routing primitive doesn't carry
  request-scoped state across `subAgent()` calls today.
- **Backpressure.** A chatty helper firing many events per second
  vs. our existing chunk batching. `ResumableStream` already has
  `CHUNK_BUFFER_SIZE` / `CHUNK_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE`; per-channel batching
  is a Ring 1 detail but worth confirming the helper protocol
  doesn't generate event volumes the existing batching can't keep up
  with.

### Ring 6 — Think specifics

Think has fibers / sessions / turns as first-class concepts that
AIChatAgent doesn't:

- A helper run could naturally be a **child fiber** of the parent
  turn's fiber, with cancellation following the fiber tree.
- Helper state could persist in a Think **session** scoped to
  the helper, with the durable channel being the session's
  externally visible event log.
- The `beforeStep` hook (#1394) is a natural place to inject helper
  lifecycle decisions ("if step 0, force the planner-helper before
  the LLM gets to choose").

Historical note: at this point in the design, AIChatAgent had none of
these. The shipped implementation later added a narrower AIChatAgent
adapter that reuses `saveMessages()` instead of growing AIChatAgent
toward Think.

**Provisional answer:** design Think-first, with the durable
multi-channel primitive (Ring 1) being framework-wide. AIChatAgent
inherits Ring 1 (existing usage just becomes the `chat` channel)
but doesn't grow helper support until there's reason to.

## Open questions

Concrete ones the design has to answer before it can ship:

1. **What's the public name for "sense (2) sub-agents"?** "Helpers"?
   "Tasks"? "Workers"? "Sub-tasks"? Avoid colliding with the existing
   "sub-agent" routing terminology. (Internal note: we've been calling
   them helpers in this doc, which is fine, but the public name
   matters for docs and API ergonomics.)
2. **Helper-as-tool vs. helper-as-RPC: ship both, or pick one for v1?**
   Shape 2 (tool wrapper) is the ergonomic story; Shape 1 (explicit
   handle) is the escape hatch. Picking only Shape 2 forces every
   non-LLM-driven helper through the LLM's tool-decision loop, which
   isn't always what you want.
3. **AI SDK part reuse vs. separate vocabulary.** Hybrid is the
   provisional answer; needs validation against a real consumer.
4. **Per-turn vs. persistent helpers as the default lifetime.** Per-turn
   matches the most common pattern (research summarizer, code
   reviewer). Persistent matches the "background build is running"
   pattern. Both are real.
5. **Cancellation semantics on partial failure.** When one of three
   parallel helpers errors, does the LLM see an error tool-result and
   continue, or does the whole turn fail?
6. **Helpers across hibernation.** Parent DO hibernates while three
   helpers are running. On wake, the durable channel restores the
   event logs (Ring 1 handles this). But are the helpers themselves
   still running? Sub-agents are colocated facets — they presumably
   wake too. Need to confirm and add a smoke test.
7. **Retention boundary.** Helper event log lives for as long as the
   parent turn lives, then GCs. Helper sub-agent storage lives for
   as long as the helper sub-agent lives, which might be longer.
   These two retention windows aren't the same and probably shouldn't
   be conflated.
8. **Migration of the existing `cf_ai_chat_stream_*` tables.** If
   Ring 1 changes the table layout, existing AIChatAgent / Think
   deployments need a migration story. Options: rename the chat
   channel's tables in-place during constructor; teach the multi-channel
   reader to also read the legacy tables transparently; defer migration
   to a major bump. Pick before shipping Ring 1.
9. **Wrangler config implications.** Helper classes need to be exported from
   the Worker entry point so `ctx.exports` can resolve them, but they should
   not be bound or listed in `new_sqlite_classes` unless they are also used as
   top-level Durable Objects.
10. **Test infrastructure.** `examples/assistant` finally got a
    vitest+workers harness in #1384's follow-ups. Helper streaming
    needs equivalent coverage: parent broadcasts a helper event,
    client receives it, mid-helper refresh replays cleanly. The
    harness pattern from `assistant/src/tests/` is the reference.

## Recommended staged plan

Don't ship just the OP's ctor args. Don't try to design and ship
the whole helper system in one PR. Stage it.

### Stage 1: minimal framework change for `messageType` (NOT SHIPPED)

Originally planned as a small ctor option per the 2026-04-27 pivot
that itself dropped the larger Ring 1 plan. The implementation
landed in `acce611c` and was then reverted on 2026-04-28 once it
became clear the pivot also obviates `messageType`: helpers run on
their own DOs (so their `_resumableStream` can never share a
connection with the parent's chat without a deliberate broadcast
relay, which we don't do). With nothing using a non-default
`messageType`, the option is speculative public API and the
revert keeps `ResumableStream`'s surface unchanged.

The original plan kept here as historical context:

```ts
export class ResumableStream {
  constructor(sql: SqlTaggedTemplate, options?: { messageType?: string });
}
```

`messageType` defaults to `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE` so
existing chat callers (`AIChatAgent.ts`, `think.ts`, the 1463-line
`resumable-streaming.test.ts` regression suite) compile and behave
byte-identically. Helper sub-agents construct
`new ResumableStream(this.sql.bind(this), { messageType: "helper-event" })`
and their replay frames go out with the right wire tag.

The `tablePrefix` part of the OP's original proposal is _not_
needed: each helper has its own DO and therefore its own SQLite —
table-level collisions are impossible by isolation, not prefix.

Concrete checklist:

- [ ] add `messageType` ctor option, replace four hardcoded
      `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.USE_CHAT_RESPONSE` references in
      `replayChunks` with `this._messageType`
- [ ] verify existing `resumable-streaming.test.ts` (1463 lines)
      passes unchanged
- [ ] CHANGESET (`agents` patch — additive, fully back-compat)
- [ ] (Optional) close #1377 referencing this commit

This is roughly a 10-LOC change. The bulk of the work for "agents
as tools" is in Stage 2, not Stage 1. The framework only needs to
get out of the way.

**What's _not_ in Stage 1 anymore** (parked, not killed):

- multi-channel `ResumableStream` schema redesign
- table prefix parameterization
- migration of `cf_ai_chat_stream_*`
- per-channel state machines

This parked list is historical context, not a recommendation to revive the
multi-channel design. For helpers, single-channel-per-DO + parent
forwarding is the better fit and what Stage 2 builds on.

### Stage 2: prototype helper streaming in `examples/agents-as-tools`

Build a new focused example, **`examples/agents-as-tools`**, that
exists specifically to flesh out this story as the design firms up.
Think-based, kept deliberately small and crisp — same role
`examples/multi-ai-chat` plays for the routing primitive.

Why a new focused example, not a tab inside `examples/ai-chat` or
`examples/assistant`:

- `examples/ai-chat` is the AIChatAgent reference and is built on a
  framework that doesn't have Think's fibers / sessions / turns
  (Ring 6). The original helper prototype stayed Think-first so it
  could exercise sessions / turns / fibers; AIChatAgent support landed
  later as a framework adapter rather than as the reference example.
- `examples/assistant` is already the kitchen-sink stress test. It
  earned that role by accumulating real features (multi-session,
  shared workspace, shared MCP, OAuth, MCP). Bolting an actively-
  evolving design onto it makes every churny iteration risk
  regressing the rest. We can fold helpers into `assistant` _later_,
  after the API stabilizes — same trajectory routing took
  (`multi-ai-chat` proved it, `assistant` integrated it).
- A focused example is the unit of fast iteration. Keeping it small
  is the point.

Why the name `examples/agents-as-tools`:

- It's the well-known, Googleable phrase for the pattern (Swarm,
  AI SDK, "tool that's another agent"). Users searching for this
  will type those words.
- It captures the most likely shipped headline API — `helperTool(Cls)`
  wrapping a sub-agent into an AI SDK tool, which is Ring 3 Shape 2.
- It pairs cleanly with the existing examples taxonomy:
  - `examples/multi-ai-chat` — minimal proof of sub-agent **routing**
    (sense 1, sibling chats)
  - `examples/agents-as-tools` — minimal proof of sub-agents **as
    turn-scoped helpers** (sense 2, inline events)
  - `examples/assistant` — kitchen-sink that combines both
- Crucially, the name doesn't lock us into a public name for "sense
  (2) sub-agents" — that's still an open question (#1 in the list
  above). "Agents-as-tools" describes the _pattern_, not the
  framework primitive's name. If we later decide the public name is
  "helpers," "tasks," or "workers," the example name still makes
  sense — those are all instances of agents-as-tools.

Concrete first helper to build:

- **Research summarizer.** Takes a query, fans out to a few search
  tools, returns a synthesis. Per-turn lifetime. Pure LLM helper.
  Fits AI SDK part vocabulary cleanly.

Other helpers to add as the example grows, validating the harder
parts of the design:

- **Workspace planner.** Takes a multi-file edit task, plans changes,
  emits per-file progress, applies via the existing `state.*` API.
  Per-turn lifetime. Mix of LLM and pure-code phases. Tests the
  hybrid event vocabulary (Ring 2).
- **Build runner.** Kicks off a long-running build, streams stdout,
  reports exit code. Persistent (outlives the turn). Tests the
  `lifetime: "persistent"` path (Ring 5).
- **Parallel research fan-out.** Three queries dispatched at once,
  events interleaved on the WS, demuxed in the UI by `helperId`.
  Tests Ring 4's grouping / Ring 5's concurrency story.

The point of the prototype is to **answer the open questions
empirically** before freezing them in an RFC. The four post-#1384 PRs
(#1393–#1396) are the recent template for "let an example exercise
the pattern, then promote what works."

This stage _can_ modify library APIs (unlike a pure usage example) —
it's where the helper protocol APIs are first drafted. But every
modification should be cheap to revisit, because the whole point is
discovery. Hand-rolled helpers in the example's `server.ts` that we
know we'll throw away are fine.

Stub structure, mirroring `examples/multi-ai-chat`:

```
examples/agents-as-tools/
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── wrangler.jsonc
├── env.d.ts
├── index.html
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── server.ts        # Parent agent + helper class(es)
    ├── client.tsx       # Chat UI with inline helper rendering
    └── styles.css
```

The `examples/ai-chat` README gets one line added when this lands:
"For delegating work to helper agents during a turn, see
`examples/agents-as-tools`." Discovery cost stays low.

### Stage 3: write the RFC

Once Stage 2 has produced one or two prototype helpers, write
`design/rfc-inline-sub-agent-events.md` (or whatever the public name
ends up being). Format follows `design/rfc-think-multi-session.md`
and `design/rfc-ai-chat-maintenance.md`:

- Problem statement (this doc, condensed)
- Goals / non-goals
- The picked answers to the open questions, with rationale
- Public API surface
- Migration / compatibility
- Alternatives considered
- Open questions still deferred

The RFC is _not_ this doc. This doc is the brain dump that informs
it; the RFC commits to specific shapes.

### Stage 4: implement the helper protocol in the framework

Land in stages, each its own PR. Per the 2026-04-27 pivot, the
shape of these PRs is simpler than the original plan because
helpers are sub-agents and the streaming primitive stays single-
channel:

1. Helper event vocabulary types in `agents/chat` (or a new
   `agents/helpers` subpath).
2. **Tiny `EventStreamingAgent` recipe / mixin / base class** —
   just enough to make "helper Agent that exposes a
   `ReadableStream` of events over RPC and durably stores them in
   its own `ResumableStream`" cheap to write. Could be a 50-LOC
   base class or a documented pattern; defer naming until we have
   two consumers.
3. **Parent-side `runHelper(Cls, args)`** that wraps the
   `subAgent` + `startAndStream` + active-helpers-tracking +
   forward-broadcast pattern. Returns the helper's final result.
4. `helperTool(Cls)` AI SDK tool wrapper — sugar over `runHelper`
   that exposes a helper as a tool the LLM can call directly.
5. Client-side `UIMessagePart` extension and renderer in
   `useAgentChat`. Probably lands as part of, or right after, the
   PR 3 hoist of `useAgentChat` into `agents/react` (see
   `wip/think-multi-session-assistant-plan.md`).
6. Cancellation propagation through `abortSubAgent`.
7. Lifetime / retention / quota plumbing — including the
   "subscribe to live tail" capability that lets a parent
   re-establish a forwarding loop after its own crash (separate
   from per-turn helpers, where the run is allowed to be
   interrupted).
8. Documentation in `docs/`. Decide whether `docs/agents/sub-agents.md`
   gains a "helpers" section or whether they get their own doc.

Each PR is independently shippable. Each PR adds a concrete
capability to `examples/agents-as-tools`. Once the API stabilizes,
fold the most ergonomic shape (probably `helperTool(Cls)` as one more
tool kind) into `examples/assistant` and add a tiny one-tool demo to
`examples/ai-chat` so the chat-features taxonomy stays complete.

### Stage 5: decide what to promote (if anything) further

Same shape as PR 4 in `wip/think-multi-session-assistant-plan.md`:
once the API has lived in `examples/agents-as-tools` for a release or
two, decide whether specific helper classes (research summarizer,
workspace planner, build runner) should ship as library primitives,
whether the helper protocol gets its own top-level package, and
whether `examples/agents-as-tools` graduates from "focused minimal
proof" into a maintained reference example. Defer until Stage 4 is
settled.

## What this plan is optimizing for

Same instincts as the multi-session plan:

- **Unblock the OP cheaply now**, on a fix we don't regret.
- **Don't freeze the design** on one team's prototype.
- **Use a focused, throwaway-friendly example** (`examples/agents-as-tools`)
  to exercise the design before promoting any abstraction into the
  library. Avoid bolting an evolving design onto the kitchen-sink
  (`examples/assistant`) or the AIChatAgent reference
  (`examples/ai-chat`) — fold those in later, once the API has
  settled.
- **Land each piece independently** so feedback can come in
  between stages, not after.
- **Keep the primitive (Ring 1) in `agents/chat`** with the rest of
  the chat-shared layer the post-#1384 PRs have been growing.
- **Start Think-first for the helper protocol** but keep the framework
  adapter broad enough for the later AIChatAgent port.

What this plan is _not_ trying to optimize for: comprehensive
helper support in v1. Most of the questions in Ring 5 ("backpressure,"
"per-turn vs persistent," "auth context propagation") are real but
not blocking for a usable v1. They become refinement passes after the
shape is locked.

## Status

- This doc: written, design pivoted 2026-04-27 (see "Design pivot"
  section above), not formally reviewed.
- Stage 1 (`messageType` ctor option on `ResumableStream`):
  **not shipped.** Initially landed as `acce611c` (the very first
  commit on this branch, predating the v0.2 pivot). Reverted on
  2026-04-28: the pivot moved helper events onto each helper's
  own DO, so the same-WS frame-type collision `messageType` was
  designed to prevent cannot occur. No code or test in the repo
  used a non-default value. The 28 existing
  `resumable-streaming.test.ts` regression tests still pass
  unchanged (the file is in `packages/ai-chat`, despite the wip
  doc's earlier claim that it lived in `packages/agents`). The
  changeset for this option (`resumable-stream-message-type.md`)
  was deleted as part of the revert. Net framework diff vs `main`:
  zero.
- Stage 2 (`examples/agents-as-tools` prototype): **v0.1 landed**
  (helpers-as-sub-agents pattern). Concretely:
  - `Researcher` owns its own `ResumableStream` configured with
    `messageType: "helper-event"`. Events are durably stored on the
    helper's own DO before they leave its isolate.
  - `Researcher.startAndStream(query, helperId)` returns a
    `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` over DO RPC. Each chunk is one or
    more NDJSON frames (`{ sequence, body }`). This byte-stream shape
    is intentional: workerd's DO RPC stream bridge transports
    `Uint8Array` chunks, while object chunks fail at runtime with the
    opaque "Network connection lost" error tracked in
    `cloudflare/workerd#6675`. Each emitted event is stored + flushed
    before being written to the stream so reconnect replay catches up
    cleanly. The stream body is wrapped in `keepAliveWhile`, aligning
    helper live execution with Think's main-turn keepalive pattern.
  - `Assistant._runHelperTurn` decodes the byte stream, splits on
    newlines, broadcasts each event with the matching `sequence` for
    client-side dedup, and marks the helper run completed/error. It
    intentionally does **not** delete the helper in `finally`: the
    helper DO owns the durable event log, so retaining it is what lets
    completed helper timelines replay after refresh. Tracks helper
    runs in `cf_agent_helper_runs`. Helper-side errors are emitted as
    inline helper events and then surfaced as real tool failures rather
    than successful empty summaries.
  - `Assistant.onConnect` runs after Think's chat-protocol setup,
    walks `cf_agent_helper_runs`, fetches each helper's stored events
    via `getStoredEventsForRun` and replays them as `replay: true`
    frames (with the same `sequence` they had when first emitted).
    If a row was marked `interrupted` after parent wake, replay appends
    a synthetic terminal error event so the UI does not show a
    permanently-running panel.
  - The client now dedupes by `(parentToolCallId, sequence)` and
    sorted-inserts events to handle the small reconnect-window race
    where one event can arrive both as a replay frame and as a live
    broadcast, and to preserve helper-emit order even when replay and
    live frames arrive out of order.
  - The wire format gained one field (`sequence: number`); rendering
    is unchanged.

  UX/DX polish after the first working run: the composer is a regular
  single-line `Input` that submits on Enter, the header has a Clear
  button wired to `clearHistory()`, helper-event state is reset on
  local and cross-tab clears, and assistant/user text plus reasoning
  parts render through Streamdown with the standard Kumo theme bridge.
  The example's `wrangler.jsonc` also moved to `compatibility_date:
2026-04-15` so partyserver can rely on `ctx.id.name` in alarm
  handlers. The remaining gap for projects on older compat dates
  was fixed in `partyserver` 0.5.4 ([`cloudflare/partykit#390`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/issues/390))
  via a defensive `__ps_name` storage write on first fetch.

  **Refresh-during-helper and refresh-after-helper-completion now work
  correctly** — both the chat stream and helper timeline catch up.
  Completed/error helper DOs are retained until Clear/future GC so the
  timeline remains available after the assistant turn finishes. Parent
  wake with rows still marked `running` converts them to `interrupted`
  and replays whatever the helper stored before the parent died.

  Specific portability hooks for the eventual AIChatAgent port: the
  `Researcher` class extends `Agent` (not `Think`), the helper-event
  protocol doesn't reference Think types, the parent forwarding code
  uses `this.broadcast(...)` (works on both AIChatAgent and Think),
  and `getTools()` returns plain AI SDK tools. The Think-only piece
  is the parent class itself; porting it to AIChatAgent is roughly a
  30-line `onChatMessage` override.

### Coverage gap vs. issue #1377's actual workload (2026-04-28)

GLips's followup
([comment 4328296343](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1377#issuecomment-4328296343))
included two screenshots of the workload he is shipping: an
orchestrator chat that dispatches `mcp_analytics_investigate`, which
fans out to several `code_mode_execute` subagents, each running their
own multi-turn loop with thinking blocks interleaved between tool
calls. Mapping that against v0.1:

The reconnect/refresh story is closed and all three depth-of-workload
gaps from GLips's screenshots — multi-turn helpers, parallel fan-out,
and per-helper drill-in — have landed. The framework promotion also
landed under the final agent tools API.

### Decisions confirmed 2026-04-28

1. **Helpers must run their own inference loop.** v0.1's `Researcher`
   scripts a deterministic step/tool-call sequence and makes one
   synthesize call. That's enough to validate the byte-stream
   contract and the replay machinery, but it doesn't exercise the
   actual workload — multi-turn agents that call multiple tools and
   reason between them. The next helper class extends Think (the same
   Think the parent uses) and runs its own inference loop, with each
   internal turn's events forwarded through the same `helper-event`
   envelope. AIChatAgent gets the equivalent treatment in a later
   stage; the protocol is already chat-framework-agnostic so the port
   is mechanical.
2. **Parallel helper fan-out is in scope, orchestrator-driven.** The
   parent LLM decides when and how to fan out — multiple `research`
   calls in one turn, or a second tool that itself dispatches a batch
   of helpers. The wire protocol is designed for this
   (`parentToolCallId + sequence` demuxes per-helper streams) but it
   has not been driven under load, and the UI hasn't been
   pressure-tested with concurrent panels.
3. **Do not ship either ctor option from #1377 (`tablePrefix` or
   `messageType`).** The 2026-04-27 pivot is the answer to the
   same-DO collision GLips originally hit: helpers run on their
   own DOs and therefore have their own SQLite, so two
   `ResumableStream` instances cannot collide on tables by
   construction (kills `tablePrefix`); and helpers don't share a
   WebSocket with the parent's chat in a way that needs frame-type
   demux because we forward chunks via the parent's `broadcast()`
   wrapped in our own `helper-event` envelope rather than running
   a second `ResumableStream` over the same connection (kills
   `messageType`). `messageType` was actually shipped as
   `acce611c` before this realization landed and was reverted on
   2026-04-28 once it became clear no caller used it. Net
   framework diff vs `main` is now zero. The #1377 issue reply
   will explain this rather than landing the literal patch.
4. **Per-helper drill-in detail view is in scope.** The routing
   primitive already supports it (`useAgent({ sub: [...] })` against
   the helper's name). v0.1 calls this out as "free" but doesn't
   wire it up. The example will grow a per-helper detail panel so
   the affordance is demonstrated, not just claimed.
5. **First-class framework integration (`helperTool(Cls)`,
   `EventStreamingAgent`) is deferred.** Today's hand-rolled
   `_runHelperTurn(cls, ...)` is the proto-shape of `helperTool(Cls)`;
   collapsing it into a framework helper is correct but premature
   while the protocol is still being validated against multi-turn
   and parallel cases. Promote after those land.

### Hibernation / fibers gaps after v0.1

The current prototype has a coherent reconnect story, but it is not
yet the same durability story as Think's main chat turns.

What works now:

- **Active-helper reconnect.** While the parent is alive and a helper
  is running, the parent tracks the run in `cf_agent_helper_runs`.
  Reconnecting clients replay the helper's stored events from the
  helper DO, then continue receiving live forwarded events.
- **Completed-helper reconnect.** Completed/error helper DOs are
  retained, so reconnect after the assistant turn finishes can still
  replay the helper timeline.
- **Parent wake after interrupted helper.** On parent `onStart`,
  `running` helper rows become `interrupted`. Reconnect replays the
  events stored before the parent died and appends a synthetic terminal
  error event so the UI does not show a permanently-running panel.

What is still missing:

- **Helper-side `keepAliveWhile`: implemented.** The main Think chat
  turn is wrapped in `keepAliveWhile`; helper execution now is too.
  Facets delegate heartbeat refs to the top-level parent, so helper
  execution no longer relies only on the active RPC stream / Promise
  chain for liveness.
- **Helper fibers.** Main chat turns can run inside a chat-recovery
  fiber. Helper work currently does not. A helper run could become a
  child fiber of the parent turn, but that requires a design for
  naming, result propagation, and cancellation.
- **Live-tail reattachment.** After a parent crash, there is no way for
  a newly-woken parent to reattach to an already-running helper's live
  event tail or recover the helper's eventual result. Today we mark the
  run `interrupted` instead. True persistent helpers need a
  subscribe-to-existing-tail capability plus a result/terminal-state
  handoff back to the parent.
- **Retention / GC.** Completed helpers are retained until Clear.
  Production shape needs age/count/message-retention GC, likely tied to
  chat message retention and branch deletion.
- **Hibernation test matrix.** Most of this landed with the Stage 2
  test harness — `reconnect-replay.test.ts` covers active-helper
  reconnect, completed-helper replay, parent restart →
  `interrupted` terminal event (synthetic, with and without stored
  events), and the multi-run interleave; `clear-helper-runs.test.ts`
  covers Clear deleting retained helper facets. Still missing: a
  helper DO hibernation cycle (helper evicted between completion
  and parent reconnect) and a true parent-eviction-mid-helper test
  (today the suite simulates this via `testRerunOnStart` instead of
  driving a real eviction).

- Stage 2 (`examples/agents-as-tools` test harness): **landed.**
  Originally 25 tests; now 36 after the Option B refactor, parallel
  fan-out, drill-in, review fixes, and the second-helper-class work.
  Five files (`registry`, `clear-helper-runs`, `helper-stream`,
  `reconnect-replay`, `parallel-fanout`) modeled on
  `examples/assistant/src/tests`. Test
  worker subclasses production `Assistant` and `Researcher`;
  `TestResearcher` overrides `getModel()` with a deterministic mock
  LanguageModel V3 so the helper's Think inference loop runs
  end-to-end without a Workers AI binding. The mock has an `ok` /
  `throws` mode so the B2 error-surfacing path can be exercised
  inside the harness too.
- Stage 2 (multi-turn Think helper, "Option B" from the design pivot
  discussion): **landed 2026-04-28.** Concretely:
  - `Researcher` now `extends Think<Env>` with its own `getModel`,
    `getSystemPrompt`, `getTools` (one simulated `web_search`).
    Helper runs are a real Think turn driven by `saveMessages`, and
    the helper's chat stream is the canonical durable event log via
    Think's own `_resumableStream`. There is **no second
    `ResumableStream`** on the helper — the same-DO collision the
    original #1377 was about cannot occur.
  - The helper-event vocabulary collapsed from six kinds
    (`started` / `step` / `tool-call` / `tool-result` / `finished` /
    `error`) to four (`started` / `chunk` / `finished` / `error`).
    Lifecycle (`started` / `finished` / `error`) is synthesized by
    the parent from `cf_agent_helper_runs` row data so panels render
    even before any chunks arrive and replay correctly without a
    stored terminal chunk; `chunk` carries an opaque JSON-encoded
    `UIMessageChunk` body forwarded verbatim from the helper's
    `_streamResult`.
  - `Researcher` overrides `broadcast` to tee `MSG_CHAT_RESPONSE`
    chunks into the active RPC stream while a `runTurnAndStream` is
    in flight. Other broadcasts (state, identity, MSG_CHAT_MESSAGES,
    direct WS clients of the helper) pass through untouched, so
    drill-in via `useAgent({ sub: [...] })` still produces a working
    chat against the helper.
  - `cf_agent_helper_runs` schema gained four columns:
    `helper_type`, `query`, `summary`, `error_message`. All four
    feed the parent's synthesized lifecycle events on `onConnect`
    replay; no helper RPC is needed to reconstruct the panel.
  - `Researcher` exposes `getChatChunksForReplay` (reads Think's own
    stored chunks via `_resumableStream.getStreamChunks`) and
    `getFinalTurnText` (returns the assistant message persisted by
    THIS turn, identified by diffing message ids against a snapshot
    captured at turn start) for the parent's reconnect-replay and
    tool-output paths.
  - The client uses `applyChunkToParts` from `agents/chat` to
    accumulate the helper's `UIMessage.parts` from the forwarded
    chunk firehose — the same primitive `useAgentChat` uses for the
    assistant's main message. Inline rendering shows text, reasoning
    blocks, and internal tool calls, exactly the way GLips's
    screenshots in #1377-comment-4328296343 show them.
  - Tests rewritten end-to-end. `TestResearcher` overrides
    `getModel()` with a deterministic mock LanguageModel V3 so a
    real Think turn can run inside the harness with no AI binding.
    Reconnect-replay tests seed pre-built `UIMessageChunk` bodies
    via `testWriteChunks(chunks, status)`, which writes through
    Think's own `_resumableStream` exactly the way production does.
  - The client renders helper events as a mini-chat panel (text +
    reasoning + tool calls) instead of the previous timeline of
    typed lifecycle lines. The shape mirrors how `useAgentChat`
    renders the assistant's message because it IS the same chunk
    vocabulary.
- Stage 2 (Option B review fixes): **landed 2026-04-28** as a
  follow-up commit to the Option B refactor. Eight of nine review
  findings addressed; B3 (schema migration for existing v0.1 DOs)
  deferred — still a prototype, wipe `.wrangler/state` after pulling
  for a clean run.
  - **B1 + B2 — actual error message surfaced to the user.** Think's
    `_streamResult` catches inference errors internally and broadcasts
    them as `error: true` chat-response frames whose `body` is the
    error string (not a `UIMessageChunk`). v0.2 originally forwarded
    those bodies into the chunk pipeline, where `applyChunkToParts`
    silently dropped them on the client; the user only saw the
    generic "Researcher finished without producing assistant text"
    fallback. Fix: `Researcher.broadcast` detects `error: true`
    frames and stashes the body in `_lastStreamError`; the parent's
    `_runHelperTurn` reads `helper.getLastStreamError()` when no
    summary is produced and surfaces the actual error.
  - **B4 — helper-side abort plumbing.** First attempt captured
    `requestId` from `saveMessages`'s return value into
    `_activeRequestId`, then targeted `_aborts.cancel(requestId)`
    in the helper's `cancel` callback. Reviewer found this dead
    code (2026-04-28): `_activeRequestId` is only assigned AFTER
    `saveMessages` resolves (i.e. after the inference loop has
    already finished), and the synchronous span between the
    assignment and `releaseClaim()` clearing it back to undefined
    has no awaits, so `cancel()` cannot observe it set during a
    real cancellation. Second attempt switched to
    `_aborts.destroyAll()` (helper is single-purpose, `_runInProgress`
    guarantees one in-flight turn at a time so destroyAll is
    safe) — that works mid-inference but races against
    `saveMessages`'s lazy controller creation: if the cancel
    arrives before Think's `_aborts.getSignal(requestId)` call,
    the registry is empty and destroyAll is a no-op. **Resolved
    via [`cloudflare/agents#1406`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1406):**
    `Think.saveMessages` now accepts `options.signal`; the helper's
    `runTurnAndStream` owns a per-turn `AbortController`, threads
    its signal into `saveMessages({ signal })`, and aborts the
    controller from the `ReadableStream` `cancel` callback. No
    race window — even pre-aborted signals are observed at the
    registry's `linkExternal` call and the inference is skipped.
    `AbortRegistry` gained a `linkExternal(id, signal)` helper that
    handles both already-aborted and not-yet-aborted cases, and
    detaches the listener in `finally` to prevent leaks across
    long-lived parent signals. Think/AIChatAgent gained `protected
abortRequest(id)` / `abortAllRequests()`; the bracket-access
    workaround in the helper's `abortCurrentTurn` is gone.
  - **H1 — final-turn text resolved by snapshot/diff.** Replaced
    `getFinalAssistantText` (walked backwards through `messages`)
    with `getFinalTurnText`, which captures the set of pre-turn
    assistant ids in `_preTurnAssistantIds` before `saveMessages`
    runs and returns the first NEW assistant message after.
    Robust against drill-in clients appending their own turns
    before the parent reads the summary; v0.2's previous behavior
    would have fed a drill-in user's text back to the orchestrator
    as the helper's research result.
  - **H2 — concurrent-call guard.** `_runInProgress` boolean set
    sync at entry of `runTurnAndStream`, cleared in `finally` /
    `cancel` via a `releaseClaim` closure. Throws on the second
    concurrent call before either's `start` callback fires (an
    `_activeForwarder !== undefined` check would race because
    `start` is invoked lazily on first read). The guard is verified
    by code review rather than test — both available test paths
    tripped over a workerd JSRPC quirk that doesn't affect
    correctness but lights up vitest's unhandled-error detector;
    documented inline alongside where the test would have lived.
  - **H4 — helper `chatRecovery`.** Helpers now keep Think chat
    recovery enabled. The helper can recover its own turn inside the
    facet; the parent still marks the inline helper row `interrupted`
    if it loses the original RPC reader, until a live-tail policy can
    reattach to recovered work.
  - **S1 — dropped redundant `keepAliveWhile` wrap.** `saveMessages`
    already wraps its body; the outer wrap was a leftover.
  - **S2 — orphan stream cleanup.** `getChatChunksForReplay` detects
    a `streaming` metadata row whose live LLM reader is gone
    (orphaned by hibernation) and finalizes it before returning the
    chunks. Prevents per-helper `streaming`-row leaks that would
    otherwise wait for `_maybeCleanupOldStreams`'s 24-hour GC.
  - **B3 — schema migration: not addressed.** `cf_agent_helper_runs`
    gained four columns in the Option B refactor; `create table if
not exists` doesn't ALTER. Existing v0.1 deployments would fail
    on INSERT. Documented as "wipe `.wrangler/state`" for now,
    promote to a real migration if the example graduates beyond
    prototype.
  - Two new tests added (29 total): `B2` end-to-end (drives the mock
    in `throws` mode and asserts the parent surfaces the actual
    error); `H1` (`getFinalTurnText` returns null on a never-ran
    helper, returns this turn's text after a successful run).
  - Other review items left as-is: **H3** (`_lastClientTools` /
    `_lastBody` leak across drill-in vs parent-driven turns —
    benign with no client tools defined, document if drill-in lands)
    and **H5** (`clearHelperRuns` mid-active-run race — best-effort
    cleanup, transient flicker, not worth complicating the callable).
- Stage 2 (parallel helper fan-out): **landed 2026-04-28.** Both
  fan-out shapes are wired and tested:
  - **Alpha** (LLM-driven): the LLM calls `research` multiple times
    in one turn (AI SDK `parallel_tool_calls` default). Each helper
    runs in its own facet under its own `parentToolCallId` and
    renders as one panel under one chat tool part.
  - **Beta** (programmer-driven): a new `compare(a, b)` tool's
    `execute` dispatches both helpers via `Promise.all`. Both share
    the chat tool call's `parentToolCallId`; the wire format
    distinguishes them by `event.helperId`. Renders as two sibling
    panels under one chat tool part — the visible "fan-out from one
    tool call" pattern from #1377-comment-4328296343 image 3.
  - Client refactor to support Beta:
    `helperStateByToolCall: Record<parentToolCallId, Record<helperId,
HelperState>>`; dedup key extended from `(parentToolCallId,
sequence)` to `(parentToolCallId, helperId, sequence)` because
    two parallel helpers under one tool call both legitimately emit
    a `sequence: 0` started event. `<MessageParts>` renders an array
    of `<HelperPanel>`s per tool part rather than a single panel.
  - Three new tests in `parallel-fanout.test.ts`: Alpha live
    broadcast (different parentToolCallIds), Beta live broadcast
    (same parentToolCallId, distinct helperIds), and Beta replay
    (`onConnect` walks two seeded rows sharing parentToolCallId
    and emits per-helper frames without sequence collisions). 32
    tests total now.
  - One new test helper: `startCollectingHelperEvents(ws)` — a
    persistent message accumulator that subscribes at call time and
    keeps a list of frames as they arrive. Needed because the
    existing `collectHelperEvents` lazily attaches a fresh
    `once`-listener per next-message and would miss broadcasts that
    happen synchronously inside an awaited `Promise.all` before any
    test-side await fires.
- Stage 2 (parallel fan-out polish pass): **landed 2026-04-28**
  follow-up to the initial fan-out commit. Five review findings
  addressed:
  - **B1: `compare` uses `Promise.allSettled` and returns a
    structured outcome** instead of `Promise.all` and throwing.
    Previously, a partial failure (one helper errored, the other
    succeeded) flipped the whole tool call to `error` while the
    surviving helper's panel still showed "Done" — a mixed signal.
    The new shape is `{ a: { query, summary | error }, b: { query,
summary | error } }`; the orchestrator LLM can react to "one of
    two succeeded" honestly. Killing the surviving helper on first
    failure is left for a future B4-style abort propagation pass
    (one parent-side abort signal would need to plumb into both
    helpers' `_aborts.cancel`).
  - **B2: deterministic panel ordering.** `started` event now
    carries an `order: number` field; the parent stamps it from a
    `displayOrder` parameter on `_runHelperTurn` (defaults to 0
    for the single-helper `research` tool; `compare` passes 0/1).
    The client sorts each tool-call's helper bucket by `order`, so
    panels appear left-to-right matching the LLM's input position
    rather than the random arrival order of `started` broadcasts.
    Persisted in `cf_agent_helper_runs.display_order` so `onConnect`
    replay synthesizes the same ordering. Schema bump applied via an
    idempotent `try { ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN } catch {}` in
    `onStart`, which doubles as a real (if minimal) migration path
    for existing v0.1 deployments — the only column the v0.1 → v0.2
    transition added that wasn't covered by `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS`. (B3 from the earlier review remains otherwise
    deferred.)
  - **N3: bulletproof dedup key.** Client's seen-sequence map is
    now keyed by `JSON.stringify([parentToolCallId, helperId])`
    rather than a `${parent}::${helper}` template. Removes the
    theoretical collision when either id contains `::` (no real-
    world ids do, but the array form is collision-proof for free).
  - **C1: three-helper Beta test.** Added a 3-helper fan-out test
    that stresses the broadcast path under N>2 — three concurrent
    `_runHelperTurn` calls under one parentToolCallId, each with
    its own `displayOrder`. All three rows complete; live frames
    demux per-helper with monotonic sequences each starting at 0.
  - **C2: replay-order assertion.** Existing replay test now also
    asserts (a) `started` events on replay carry the row's
    `display_order` as `order`, and (b) `onConnect` replay does NOT
    interleave per-helper frames — helper-x's last frame arrives
    before helper-y's first. Pins down the per-row serialization
    `onConnect` does today against a future "interleave for
    fairness" refactor.
- Stage 2 (per-helper drill-in detail view): **landed 2026-04-28.**
  Each helper panel grew a small ↗ button; clicking it opens a side
  panel that runs `useAgentChat` directly against the helper's
  sub-agent URL (`useAgent({ agent: "Assistant", name: DEMO_USER,
sub: [{ agent: "Researcher", name: helperId }] })`). The framework's
  routing primitive does all the work — no parent intervention, no
  cross-DO state, just a normal chat hook against a sub-agent. The
  side panel renders messages with the same `<MessageParts>`
  component the main chat uses; sending a follow-up message in the
  panel triggers a real Think turn on the helper with the parent's
  original query already in context. Confirms the "drill-in is real
  chat, not a custom event view" promise of Option B and validates
  Ring 4's drill-in question — the answer is "free, given the helper
  IS a chat agent."

  Implementation notes worth keeping handy:
  - The drill-in side panel is a fixed overlay (full-height,
    backdrop click / Escape / ✕ button to close). The state is a
    single `drillInHelperId: string | null` on App; the panel reads
    `helperType` and `query` from the existing `helperStateByToolCall`
    map, so no extra plumbing was needed.
  - The drill-in connection is a separate WebSocket from the parent
    chat. While a turn is running, both update live: the inline panel
    via the parent's broadcast tee, the side panel via the helper's
    own chat-protocol broadcasts. Same chunks, two angles.
  - **`onBeforeSubAgent` is open.** Any helperId routes through to a
    fresh facet if it's not in the registry; the demo doesn't gate.
    Production should add a `cf_agent_helper_runs` lookup so an
    attacker can't spawn arbitrary helper DOs by guessing ids.
    Documented as out-of-scope in the README.
  - **Ring-4-like nested drill-in (helper → its sub-helper) is not
    wired.** Helpers in this example don't dispatch their own
    helpers. The protocol supports it (each level would have its own
    `parentToolCallId`); only the UI would need an additional level
    of recursion to render. Flagged for Stage 5.
  - **H3 review item revisited.** Sending a message in the drill-in
    panel goes through the helper's `onChatMessage` → `saveMessages`,
    which reads `_lastClientTools` / `_lastBody`. With no client
    tools defined, this is a no-op leak; with client tools, the
    drill-in client's tool schemas would persist and could
    contaminate a subsequent parent-driven turn (since both go
    through `saveMessages`). Documented; not a fix in this commit.

- Stage 2 (drill-in review polish): **landed 2026-04-28**
  follow-up to the drill-in commit. Four review findings addressed:
  - **D1: replay reads back THIS turn's chunks, not "latest".**
    The previous `getChatChunksForReplay` picked the most recent
    stream by `created_at`. After a drill-in user fired a follow-up
    turn through the side-panel composer, the helper's
    `_resumableStream` had a NEW stream (turn 2). On parent reconnect,
    the inline panel rebuilt from turn 2's chunks even though the
    parent's tool output and `summary` row column reflected turn 1.
    Fix: capture the helper's stream id after `saveMessages` resolves
    (`_lastTurnStreamId`, exposed via `getLastTurnStreamId()`), stash
    it in `cf_agent_helper_runs.stream_id`, and have
    `getChatChunksForReplay(streamId?)` accept an explicit id.
    `onConnect` reads `row.stream_id` and passes it through. Schema
    bump applied via the same idempotent ALTER TABLE pattern as
    `display_order`. Regression test in `reconnect-replay.test.ts`
    seeds turn 1 then writes a "turn 2" stream via the new
    `testWriteAdditionalHelperChunks` seam, verifies replay returns
    turn 1's body and not turn 2's.
  - **D2: `<DrillInPanel>` is keyed by `helperId`.** Switching from
    one helper's drill-in to another now fully unmounts/remounts the
    panel — tears down the previous `useAgent` WebSocket cleanly,
    resets the composer's input state, and avoids any prop-vs-hook-
    arg drift. One-line fix.
  - **N1: status badge in drill-in header.** Mirrors the inline
    panel's Running / Done / Error badge so the side panel's header
    feels consistent with the panel the user just clicked through
    from. The prop is named `helperStatus` (not `status`) to avoid
    colliding with `useAgentChat`'s own `status` symbol inside the
    component body.
  - **N2: system-prompt nudge for `compare` partial failure.** Added
    one line to `Assistant.getSystemPrompt`: "If a `compare` result
    includes an `error` field for one branch, acknowledge the gap
    and synthesize from the successful branch only." The structured
    `Promise.allSettled` shape from the polish pass already gives
    the LLM the data; this nudge tells it what to do with it.

  Tests: 34 (was 33). Both typechecks clean.

  Drill-in review items deliberately punted on:
  - **N3 (no "currently in a parent turn" indicator on the drill-in
    side panel).** `useAgentChat`'s `status` is per-connection;
    doesn't tell the side panel "the parent is also using this
    helper right now." The chunks streaming live make it visually
    obvious in practice, so this stays as a UX nit until someone
    actually misreads the state.
  - **E1 (per-drill-in-follow-up stream metadata growth).** Each
    follow-up turn the user fires through the drill-in adds a row to
    the helper's `cf_ai_chat_stream_metadata` and chunks to
    `cf_ai_chat_stream_chunks`. `_maybeCleanupOldStreams` GCs them
    eventually (24h cutoff for completed streams). For the demo this
    is fine; production should consider a tighter retention policy
    once Ring 5 is settled.
  - **E2 (concurrent drill-in tabs).** Two browser tabs against the
    same helper both can `sendMessage`; their turns serialize through
    Think's `_turnQueue` and both see both turns via broadcast. No
    corruption, just slightly weird co-editing UX. Acceptable.
  - **E3 (drill-in opens during STREAM_RESUMING).** Theoretically
    works — Think's `onConnect` wrapper sends `STREAM_RESUMING` if
    there's an active stream, useAgentChat ACKs and replays. Not
    manually validated. Worth a smoke test if it ever feels glitchy
    in the wild.
  - ~~**E4 (`onBeforeSubAgent` gate is open).**~~
    **Landed 2026-04-28** as part of the production-shape polish
    pass. `Assistant.onBeforeSubAgent` now does a
    `(helper_id, helper_type)` registry lookup and returns 404
    on miss. Six new tests pin the lifecycle. See the Stage 2
    "production-shape polish" entry above.
  - **Focus trap / `aria-modal` on the drill-in side panel.**
    Accessibility-correct modal behavior would trap Tab / Shift-Tab
    inside the panel and announce `role="dialog"` to screen readers.
    Currently neither is wired. Acceptable for a demo, real for a
    production lift of this UI.
  - ~~**No drill-in / browser-level tests.**~~
    **Landed 2026-04-28** as a Playwright + `vite dev` + real
    Workers AI suite at `examples/agents-as-tools/e2e/`. Seven
    tests covering: smoke, research → drill-in, plan → drill-in
    (the `e9c0e0ff` regression), `compare` two-panel fan-out,
    refresh-replay (single + multi-helper), and Clear-then-reload.
    Each test runs against a fresh Assistant DO via a `?user=<id>`
    query-param override the client now honors. The unique
    user gives each test its own Assistant DO for clean state
    isolation. Full suite ~4-5 minutes locally; `retries: 1`
    rides out occasional Workers AI 504s. Run with
    `npm run test:e2e`.

    What's NOT covered (and why):
    - Refresh DURING an in-flight helper turn. Hard to make
      deterministic against real LLMs without complex timing
      gates; punted.
    - The C2 unknown-`helperType` error state in `<DrillInPanel>`.
      Reaching the state requires a row with a `helper_type` not
      in `KNOWN_HELPER_TYPES`, which the framework's URL parser
      filters on `ctx.exports`. The branch is verified by code
      review and would only fire from a manual bypass; not worth
      a dedicated test.
    - Recursive drill-in (helper → its own sub-helper). Not
      implemented in the example; no panel to test.

    Filed and fixed: the per-test unique-user pattern was
    originally also a workaround for a `partyserver` 0.5.3 bug
    where alarms inside helper facets lost `ctx.id.name` when
    they fired after a dev-server restart
    ([cloudflare/partykit#390](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/issues/390)).
    `partyserver` 0.5.4 fixed it via a defensive `__ps_name`
    write on first fetch. The unique-user pattern stays for
    test isolation but is no longer compensating for an upstream
    bug.

  - **`compare`'s tool output duplicates `query` per branch.** The
    `query` for each branch is in both the helper's panel header
    AND the tool output's `{a: { query, summary }, b: { ... }}`
    structure. The LLM consumes the structured output; the user
    sees the panel. Slightly redundant for the user view, fine for
    the LLM. Not worth complicating the schema.

- Stage 2 (second helper class — `Planner`): **landed 2026-04-28.**
  Closes the "is the vocabulary right?" gap from Ring 2 by exercising
  the helper-event protocol against a non-research workload.

  Concretely:
  - Extracted `HelperAgent extends Think<Env>` as the shared base.
    All helper-protocol bits (`broadcast` tee, `runTurnAndStream`,
    lifecycle accessors, `_lastTurnStreamId` / `_lastStreamError` /
    `_preTurnAssistantIds`, chat recovery policy, the concurrent-call
    guard) live there. Concrete helpers stay thin
    — pick a model, a system prompt, and a tool surface.
  - Added `Planner extends HelperAgent` with a different system
    prompt (writes structured implementation plans) and a single
    simulated `inspect_file` tool. Same RPC surface as `Researcher`
    by virtue of the shared base.
  - Generalized `Assistant.runResearchHelper` →
    `_runHelperTurn(cls, query, parentToolCallId, displayOrder?)`.
    The `cls` parameter is typed as `HelperClass`, derived from the
    `helperClassByType` registry below; inside the function
    `cls.name` feeds the row's `helper_type` column and
    `subAgent(cls, ...)` spawns the right facet.
  - Added a class registry `helperClassByType = { Researcher,
Planner } as const` used by `onConnect` / `clearHelperRuns` to
    resolve the row's stored `helper_type` string back to the
    concrete class. The `HelperClass` union type derives from this
    registry's values via `keyof typeof`, so adding a class is one
    site (the registry) and the type, the `_runHelperTurn` arg, and
    the `helperClassFor` lookup all flow from there.
    Falls back to `Researcher` (with a `console.warn`) for unknown
    types — defensive default
    for rows from earlier schema generations.
  - Added the `plan(description)` tool, dispatching `Planner` via
    `_runHelperTurn`. Updated the Assistant's system prompt to nudge
    the LLM toward `plan` for "how do I implement X" queries.
  - Planner is exported from the Worker entry point so sub-agent routing can
    resolve it.
  - Test worker grew a `Planner` test subclass — same mock-model
    plumbing as `TestResearcher`, deliberately duplicated rather
    than mixed in (TypeScript class mixins are gnarlier than two
    ~30-line classes are noisy). Test seams accept an optional
    `className: "Researcher" | "Planner"` arg, default
    `"Researcher"` so existing tests don't thread it through.
  - Tests: 36 (was 34). Two new — Planner end-to-end through the
    byte-stream protocol (validates the same NDJSON / chunk
    storage / final-text pipe holds against a non-Researcher
    helper) and a mixed-class clear test (verifies
    `clearHelperRuns` resolves the right facet table for each
    row's `helper_type`, not hardcoded to `Researcher`).

  What this validates for Stage 4:
  - The `HelperAgent` base IS the shape `helperTool(Cls)` will
    accept — `Cls extends HelperAgent` is a plausible constraint.
  - The class registry pattern in `Assistant` is what
    `helperTool(Cls)` would generate as part of its setup.
  - `_runHelperTurn` is the ~80-line body that should move into
    the framework helper. Everything else in `Assistant`
    (`getTools`, `onStart`, schema migration) stays as consumer
    code.

- Stage 2 (second-helper-class review fixes): **landed 2026-04-28**
  follow-up to `02ab6d05` based on a deep read across both that
  commit and the drill-in routing fix `e9c0e0ff`.
  - **M1 (`cls.name` minification fragility): not changed.** Top-
    level class exports keep their names through esbuild and Vite's
    `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` because workerd reads classes from
    `ctx.exports` and requires the names to match the wrangler
    binding strings, so they have to survive the build. If future
    tooling did mangle them, migration is a one-shot
    `UPDATE cf_agent_helper_runs SET helper_type='Researcher'
WHERE helper_type=<oldMangledKey>` plus the same for Planner.
    Documented; not blocking.
  - **M2 (registry-derived `HelperClass` type): landed.**
    `helperClassByType` is now `as const`; `HelperClass` is
    derived as `(typeof helperClassByType)[keyof typeof
helperClassByType]`. Adding a class is one site (the registry):
    the type, the `_runHelperTurn` arg, and the `helperClassFor`
    lookup all flow from there. The fallback for unknown
    `helper_type` strings now also `console.warn`s once so drift
    surfaces early instead of silently returning Researcher.
  - **C1 (Planner-specific replay test): landed.** New test in
    `reconnect-replay.test.ts` seeds a `helperType: "Planner"` row
    plus chunks and asserts `onConnect` replay emits `started`
    (carrying `helperType: "Planner"`), the seeded `chunk`, and
    `finished`. Catches a regression where `onConnect` would fall
    back to hardcoded `Researcher` on the helper-class lookup.
  - **C2 (drill-in unknown-`helperType` guard): landed.** Client
    has a `KNOWN_HELPER_TYPES` set (mirrors the server registry)
    and `<DrillInPanel>` checks against it before opening a
    `useAgent`. On miss, the side panel renders an explicit
    "Unknown helper class: X" error state instead of hanging on
    the silent "Connecting to helper…" failure mode the 2026-04-28
    routing bug exposed. Composer is disabled in that state.
  - **N1 (test-seam `className` defaults removed): landed.** All
    class-aware seams (`hasHelper`, `testRunHelperToCompletion`,
    `testReadStoredHelperChunks`, `testReadHelperFinalText`,
    `testReadHelperStreamError`, `testSetHelperMockMode`,
    `testWriteAdditionalHelperChunks`, plus a renamed
    `testRunHelper`, formerly `testRunResearchHelper`) now require
    a `className` arg. Existing tests updated to pass
    `"Researcher"` explicitly — closes the footgun where a future
    Planner test could silently check Researcher's facet table and
    pass for the wrong reason.
  - **Wrangler config simplified.** The example is not deployed anywhere, so
    helper facet classes stay out of `new_sqlite_classes`; only the top-level
    Assistant class needs a migration entry.
  - **Polish pass.** Updated `runResearchHelper` references in the
    README, server doc-comments, test file headers, and the older
    parts of this design doc to the post-rename name
    (`_runHelperTurn`); refreshed the README's "How to read this
    code" walkthrough to mention `HelperAgent` and the class
    registry; rewrote the README's "If you want to extend it"
    section since both prior bullets (parallel fan-out, drill-in)
    are now shipped features.

  Tests: 37 (was 36); one new C1 Planner replay test.

- Stage 2 (production-shape polish): **landed 2026-04-28** as a
  follow-up to the second-helper-class fixes. Two of the items
  in the README's "out of scope" table were really "deferred but
  small" rather than genuinely out-of-scope, and shipping them
  lets the example be honestly described as production-shaped
  rather than demo-shaped:
  - **B4 cancellation propagation: fully wired.** Helper-side
    cancel was already in place (the RPC stream's `cancel`
    callback aborts via Think's `_aborts`). What was missing was
    the parent-side thread: the AI SDK passes an `abortSignal` on
    each tool execute's second arg, but the example wasn't reading
    it. Each tool execute now destructures
    `{ toolCallId, abortSignal }` and threads the signal into
    `_runHelperTurn` via a new `opts.abortSignal`. The function
    registers an `abort` listener that cancels the helper RPC
    reader, which propagates over JSRPC to the helper's `cancel`
    callback. Originally that callback called the legacy
    `abortCurrentTurn` → `_aborts.destroyAll()` workaround
    (best-effort; see the B4 entry above for the race window).
    With cloudflare/agents#1406 landed, the helper now owns a
    per-turn `AbortController` whose signal is threaded into
    `Think.saveMessages({ signal })`; the cancel callback aborts
    the controller, and `linkExternal` handles both the
    "controller doesn't exist yet" and "controller already
    cancelled" cases atomically. No race window. Crucially, the
    post-loop arm in `_runHelperTurn` ALSO checks `signal.aborted`
    and throws a "Helper aborted" error rather than letting the empty
    summary fall through to the generic fallback. That error
    flows through the existing catch arm — row marked `error`,
    synthesized `error` event broadcast, panel doesn't sit on
    "Running…". This parent-side surfacing is what the B4
    vitest tests actually validate; helper-side abort
    propagation works in practice when cancels arrive
    mid-inference but races on early cancels. A `finally` arm
    detaches the listener regardless of how `_runHelperTurn`
    exits, so a parent that runs many helpers across many turns
    doesn't accumulate stale closures
    on its abort signals. Listener is registered with
    `{ once: true }` since the AI SDK's signal also fires once,
    but defensive cleanup is cheaper than auditing.
  - **E4 `onBeforeSubAgent` gate: production-shaped.**
    `Assistant` now overrides `onBeforeSubAgent` to look up the
    requested `(helperType, helperId)` in `cf_agent_helper_runs`
    and return a `404` if the row doesn't exist. Drill-in URLs
    are no longer guessable, and an attacker can't drill into a
    Researcher facet by routing through the Planner endpoint
    (the gate's `WHERE` clause is on `(helper_id, helper_type)`,
    so cross-class access fails closed). Internal `subAgent(...)`
    calls bypass the hook by design (matches `getAgentByName`
    bypassing `onBeforeConnect`), so `_runHelperTurn`'s own
    helper spawn isn't blocked by its own check. The gate also
    has an "unknown helper class" arm for defense-in-depth (covers
    the rare case of routing through a bound DO that isn't a
    helper, e.g. `Assistant`-as-child); not directly reachable
    via the framework's URL parser today (which filters by
    `ctx.exports`) but free to keep.
  - **Helper-class-agnostic error message.** The empty-summary
    fallback used to say "Researcher finished without producing
    assistant text"; updated to use `${helperType}` so a Planner
    failure now reads "Planner finished without producing
    assistant text" rather than impersonating Researcher.
  - **Tests.** New `cancellation-and-gate.test.ts` covers six
    cases: pre-aborted signal rejects with an abort error,
    pre-aborted signal marks the row `error` with an abort
    message, same for Planner (both classes share the path), gate
    rejects an unseeded helperId with 404, gate accepts a seeded
    helperId with 101, gate rejects cross-class drill-in (seed
    `Researcher/shared-id`, drill via `Planner/shared-id` → 404).

  Tests: 43 (was 37, +6 new). README's "out of scope" table is
  now four rows instead of six — what's left is genuinely Ring 5
  / Stage 4 / Stage 5 work, not "easy follow-ups we kept punting".

- Stage 2 (browser-level e2e tests): **landed 2026-04-28** as a
  Playwright + `vite dev` + real Workers AI suite at
  `examples/agents-as-tools/e2e/`. Closes the "no client-side test
  coverage" gap that let the `e9c0e0ff` drill-in routing bug ship.
  - Seven tests: smoke, research-drill-in, planner-drill-in (the
    `e9c0e0ff` regression), compare-fanout, refresh-replay (single
    - multi-helper), and clear-then-reload.
  - Each test runs against a fresh Assistant DO via a `?user=<id>`
    query-param override the client honors — gives each test
    its own Assistant DO for clean state isolation. Made
    `DEMO_USER` a fallback rather than hardcoded, with the
    URL-param override documented as a test-only hook.
  - `playwright.config.ts` boots `vite dev` automatically via
    `webServer`; `workers: 1` keeps tests serialized so they
    don't fight over Workers AI capacity; `retries: 1` rides out
    occasional 504s; `timeout: 180_000` covers the slow
    `kimi-k2.7-code` model. Headed and UI modes are wired via
    `npm run test:e2e:headed` / `npm run test:e2e:ui`.
  - Added minimal `data-testid` hooks: `helper-panel` (with
    `data-helper-type` / `data-helper-id` / `data-helper-status`)
    and `drill-in-panel`. Two stray Kumo `<Input>` a11y warnings
    fixed along the way (`aria-label` on the parent + drill-in
    composers).
  - Full suite ~4-5 minutes locally. Not wired to CI — the user's
    stated workflow is local-only for now; CI integration would
    need `playwright install --with-deps chromium` and a Workers
    AI auth shape (env var or addressable account from the CI
    runner).

  Framework gap surfaced and fixed in the same session:
  [`cloudflare/partykit#390`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/issues/390)
  — fresh partyserver 0.5.x DOs with `compatibility_date` older
  than 2026-03-15 lost `this.name` on alarm wake. The 0.5.x
  release dropped the legacy `__ps_name` write on the assumption
  the runtime change covered everything, but old compat dates
  meant the runtime didn't propagate `ctx.id.name` into alarm
  handlers and there was no fallback. partyserver 0.5.4 added a
  defensive one-time `__ps_name` write on first fetch
  (idempotent; restores the safety net pre-0.5.x had). The repo
  pins `^0.5.4` everywhere now. The e2e suite's per-test
  unique-user pattern stays for test isolation but no longer
  works around the bug.

- Stage 3 (RFC): **done 2026-04-30.** The accepted RFC is
  `design/rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md`.
- Stage 4 (framework implementation): **done 2026-04-30 for
  Think-based and AIChatAgent-based agent tools.** The final names are `runAgentTool` and
  `agentTool`, not `runHelper` / `helperTool`. The parent registry is
  `cf_agent_tool_runs`; child Think and AIChatAgent agents implement the
  internal adapter surface; the browser consumes `agent-tool-event`
  frames through `useAgentToolEvents`.
- Stage 4 example rewrite: **done 2026-04-30.** The old
  `HelperAgent`, `helper-event`, `_runHelperTurn`, and
  `cf_agent_helper_runs` prototype code was removed from
  `examples/agents-as-tools`. The example now demonstrates the public
  APIs directly.
- Stage 5 (further promotion): **mostly deferred.** No built-in
  research/planner agent classes are being promoted as library
  primitives. The maintained reference is the example plus docs.

The roadmap this WIP doc was tracking is complete for the shipped
agent-tools feature:

1. ~~**Promote `Researcher` to a multi-turn Think helper.**~~
   **Landed 2026-04-28**, then generalized into the framework child
   adapter.
2. ~~**Parallel helper fan-out, orchestrator-driven.**~~
   **Landed 2026-04-28** in the example and now uses
   `runAgentTool(...)` in `compare`.
3. ~~**Per-helper drill-in detail view.**~~
   **Landed 2026-04-28** and now routes through retained
   `cf_agent_tool_runs` entries.
4. ~~**Two-helper-class demo.**~~ **Landed 2026-04-28** with
   `Researcher` and `Planner`; the rewritten example keeps both.
5. ~~**Browser-level / e2e tests.**~~ **Landed 2026-04-28.** The
   e2e suite remains local/real-LLM oriented; framework-level coverage
   now lives in `packages/agents` and `packages/think`.
6. ~~**Framework helper.**~~ **Landed 2026-04-30** as
   `runAgentTool` and `agentTool`.
7. ~~**RFC draft.**~~ **Landed 2026-04-30** as the accepted helper
   sub-agent orchestration RFC.

What remains, if someone wants to continue from here:

See "Non-blocking follow-up work" at the top of this file. It is the
authoritative handoff list for deferred work after the framework
agent-tools feature shipped.
