# Forever Chat — Durable AI Streaming

AI chat with `chatRecovery` enabled — wraps each chat turn in `runFiber` for automatic keepAlive during streaming and recovery after DO eviction.

See [forever.md](../forever.md) for the full design doc.

## What it shows

- `chatRecovery = true` on `AIChatAgent` — wraps chat turns in fibers (`AIChatAgent` opts in; Think enables this by default)
- keepAlive during streaming — DO stays alive for long LLM responses
- `onChatRecovery` — provider-specific recovery after eviction
- `continueLastTurn()` — seamlessly continues the interrupted assistant message inline
- Multi-provider support with a dropdown selector:

| Provider   | Model             | Recovery strategy                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workers AI | kimi-k2.7-code    | Persist partial + continue via `continueLastTurn()` (text + reasoning merge into existing blocks) |
| OpenAI     | gpt-5.4           | Retrieve completed response via Responses API (`store: true`) — zero wasted tokens                |
| Anthropic  | claude-sonnet-4.6 | Persist partial + continue via synthetic user message (reasoning disabled for recovery)           |

## Run it

```bash
npm install
cd experimental/forever-chat
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
npm start
```

Workers AI works automatically (uses the `AI` binding). OpenAI and Anthropic require API keys in `.env`.

## Testing recovery

Start a long response, then restart the dev server while the model is still
streaming. On the next activation, the agent records one recovery incident and
either continues the partial assistant turn or retries the unanswered user turn,
depending on where interruption happened. If repeated recoveries exceed
`chatRecovery.maxAttempts`, the configured terminal message is persisted instead
of leaving the turn stuck.
