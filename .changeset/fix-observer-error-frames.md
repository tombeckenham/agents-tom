Treat `useAgentChat` observer error frames as terminal responses.

Plain-text error bodies are no longer parsed as stream chunks or merged into an empty assistant message. Error frames now clear observer streaming, replay, recovery, and tool-continuation state even when they omit `done`, matching the transport-owned stream behavior.
