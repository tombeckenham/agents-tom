/**
 * Sandbox — container-host Durable Object. One per Cloudflare
 * Container; minted by the warm pool; lives for the lifetime of
 * that container.
 *
 * Wiring: cross-DO. The `WorkspaceAgent` DO owns the `Workspace` instance
 * and the `CloudflareContainerBackend` that drives wsd. The backend's
 * `container: () => ...` factory returns a stub to one of these
 * Sandboxes; the backend then calls `getWorkspaceContainer()` over
 * Workers RPC to reach the runtime container handle.
 *
 * That makes this class deliberately near-empty:
 *
 *   - `withWorkspaceContainer` installs `getWorkspaceContainer()`,
 *     which the backend uses to drive `ctx.container.start()`,
 *     `ctx.container.interceptOutboundHttp()`, and
 *     `ctx.container.getTcpPort()`. That's the whole point of
 *     this DO.
 *
 *   - `WorkspaceProxy` is re-exported at the worker entrypoint
 *     (not here \u2014 it's a top-level export in `index.ts`) so wsd's
 *     `/ws` callback can route back into the WorkspaceAgent DO that owns
 *     the workspace.
 *
 *   - Three lifecycle methods (`startAndWaitForPorts`, `stop`,
 *     `getState`) survive only because the warm pool driver calls
 *     them. Each is a direct pass-through to `ctx.container.*`
 *     with no synthesised state. The pool branches on
 *     `getState().status === "healthy"`, mapped from
 *     `ctx.container.running`.
 *
 * What's *gone* compared to the prior shape: no Workspace instance,
 * no CloudflareContainerBackend, no `getWorkspace()` or `gitClone()`
 * RPC, no synthetic connect-state tracking. All of that moved to
 * WorkspaceAgent where the Workspace now lives.
