# Sub-agent Routing

How the shipped sub-agent / facet system works **today**.

See also:

- [`rfc-sub-agents.md`](./rfc-sub-agents.md) — why sub-agents were added
- [`rfc-sub-agent-routing.md`](./rfc-sub-agent-routing.md) — why external addressability shipped the way it did

## The model

Sub-agents are child Durable Objects created via `parent.subAgent(Cls, name)`.
They are implemented on top of workerd facets (`ctx.facets`) and have:

- their own isolated SQLite storage
- their own in-memory state
- their own WebSocket clients (once addressed through `/sub/...`)
- colocation with the parent on the same machine

They do **not** have independent alarm slots today. Sub-agent `schedule()` and
`scheduleEvery()` calls are logical child schedules stored in the top-level
parent's scheduler table with an owner path. When the parent alarm fires, the
SDK routes the due callback back through the facet tree and executes it inside
the owning sub-agent.

## Addressing

The URL shape is nested under the parent:

```
/agents/{parent-class}/{parent-name}/sub/{child-class}/{child-name}
```

`buildAgentPath(path, options?)` is the canonical serializer for this wire
format. It accepts the same root-first `{ className, name }[]` shape exposed by
`Agent#selfPath`, owns class conversion and name encoding, and can append a
pathname suffix. When the root Durable Object binding and class names differ,
`rootBinding` supplies the routing namespace. `buildAgentUrl(origin, path, options?)` adds
an HTTP(S) or WS(S) origin. The resulting address is transport-neutral: HTTP
requests and WebSocket upgrades use the same pathname.

The parent DO is always woken first. Its `onBeforeSubAgent(req, { className, name })`
hook can:

- allow the request through (`void`)
- mutate the request (`Request`)
- short-circuit with a response (`Response`)

After a WebSocket upgrade, frames flow directly to the child facet.

## Parent-owned registry

Each parent maintains a small framework-owned registry in SQLite as a side effect of:

- `subAgent()` — insert-or-ignore
- `deleteSubAgent()` — delete

This powers:

- `hasSubAgent(ClsOrName, name)`
- `listSubAgents(ClsOrName?)`
- strict-registry gates in `onBeforeSubAgent`

Applications can keep their own metadata tables (titles, previews, permissions),
but the registry is the source of truth for whether a child exists.

## Ancestor identity

At facet init time, the parent passes a root-first ancestor chain into the child:

```ts
this.parentPath; // ancestors only
this.selfPath; // ancestors + self
```

Example:

```
Tenant("acme")
  └─ Inbox("alice")
       └─ Chat("chat-123")
```

Inside `Chat`:

```ts
this.parentPath;
// [
//   { className: "Tenant", name: "acme" },
//   { className: "Inbox",  name: "alice" }
// ]
```

`parentPath` is **root-first**, so the direct parent is always the **last**
entry, not the first.

The SDK also passes an explicit `id` to `ctx.facets.get()` so lifecycle identity can
resolve `this.name` from `ctx.id.name` inside the facet. That ID is derived from
the top-level root/supervisor namespace, not the immediate parent, because the
immediate parent may itself be a facet and is not expected to expose namespace
helpers such as `idFromName`.

## `parentAgent(Cls)`

`Agent#parentAgent(Cls)` is the one-hop inverse of `subAgent(Cls, name)`:

- child → direct parent
- typed parent stub
- runtime check that `Cls.name` matches the direct parent class
- resolves a top-level parent from `env[Cls.name]` or the Worker `exports`
  namespace
- resolves a facet parent through a root bridge that walks the recorded facet
  path one hop at a time

For grandparents and further ancestors that are top-level Durable Objects, use
`parentPath[i]` plus `getAgentByName(...)` directly. Facet ancestors are not
individually bound in `env`, and `parentAgent()` intentionally stays a one-hop
direct-parent helper.

Top-level parent resolution prefers `env[Cls.name]` and falls back to the
Worker `exports` namespace. This supports custom Durable Object binding names
as long as the parent class is exported under its class name.

Facet-parent stubs expose normal HTTP `.fetch()` calls through the same root
bridge as RPC methods. These internal calls do not run `onBeforeSubAgent`.
WebSocket upgrade requests are not supported through `parentAgent().fetch()`
yet because WebSocket handles cannot be serialized over RPC. Use externally
routed sub-agent URLs for WebSocket connections.

## Broadcasts and state sync

Originally, facets were treated as RPC-only and broadcast paths no-op'd when
`_isFacet` was set. That assumption stopped being true once clients could
connect directly to facets through sub-agent routing.

Today:

- `this.broadcast(...)` inside a facet sends to the facet's own WS clients
- `setState()` broadcasts state updates from the facet to its own clients
- MCP server state broadcasts also reach the facet's own clients

The parent does **not** receive those broadcasts automatically — talk to it via
RPC if you need parent-side side effects.

## Lifecycle caveats

- `schedule()` / `scheduleEvery()` / `cancelSchedule()` work on facets, but the
  top-level parent owns the physical alarm.
- `getScheduleById()` / `listSchedules()` work on facets by delegating to the
  top-level parent.
- `getSchedule()` / `getSchedules()` are deprecated synchronous storage reads
  and throw on facets.
- `keepAlive()` and `keepAliveWhile()` work on facets by delegating their
  heartbeat ref to the top-level parent. Facets still do not get an independent
  physical alarm slot.
- `runFiber()` works on facets. Fiber rows and snapshots live in the child
  SQLite database, while the root parent keeps a small index of active facet
  fibers so alarm housekeeping can route recovery checks back into idle
  children.
- Think chat recovery works on facets; recovered continuations can schedule from
  the child and are routed through the top-level parent's alarm.
- `deleteSubAgent()` is idempotent and removes pending schedules for that
  descendant tree before deleting the facet.
- Class names whose kebab-case equals `"sub"` are rejected (e.g. `Sub`, `SUB`,
  `Sub_`) because they collide with the `/sub/` URL separator.

## Design tradeoffs

- **Good:** direct child connections, low-latency parent↔child RPC, clean
  parent/index + child/leaf app structure.
- **Good:** parent-owned registry gives us strict gating and enumeration for free.
- **Good:** sub-agent code can use the normal scheduling API even though the
  parent owns the runtime alarm.
- **Tradeoff:** no independent physical alarms on facets yet; the root parent
  multiplexes schedules for the whole facet tree.
- **Tradeoff:** `parentAgent(Cls)` only does the one-hop case; deeper ancestor
  lookup stays explicit.
