/**
 * A back-office operations agent that runs a real business process: look up an
 * account, then take an action that needs human sign-off.
 *
 * Sensitive tools declare `needsApproval`, which pauses the turn at an
 * approval-requested state until a human approves or rejects in the UI
 * (`addToolApprovalResponse`). If the Durable Object is evicted while waiting —
 * a deploy, a timeout — Think parks the turn instead of failing it, and the
 * eventual decision resumes the conversation. A scheduled digest runs the agent
 * proactively even when nobody is connected.
