# Programmatic Submissions

Use `submitMessages()` when a caller needs to start a Think turn, return
quickly, retry safely, and inspect the result later.

`saveMessages()` waits for the turn to finish. `submitMessages()` durably accepts
the turn and returns a submission record before inference runs.

For a broader comparison with `chat()`, `saveMessages()`, and agent tools, see
[Choosing a turn API](./index.md#choosing-a-turn-api).

Declarative scheduled prompt tasks use the same durable submission path under
the hood. Use `getScheduledTasks()` when the trigger is recurring and
code-declared; use `submitMessages()` directly when an external caller or
webhook creates one-off work.

## Why this exists

Webhook handlers, RPC callers, and parent Workers often have strict timeout
limits. If they call `saveMessages()` and time out, they cannot tell whether the
turn was never accepted, is queued, is running, or already completed. Retrying
can duplicate a user message and start a second turn.

`submitMessages()` creates a durable acceptance boundary:

```typescript
const submission = await this.submitMessages(
  [
    {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      role: "user",
      parts: [{ type: "text", text: "Process webhook event 123" }]
    }
  ],
  { idempotencyKey: "webhook-event-123" }
);
```

The caller can return `submission.submissionId` immediately. Later, call
`inspectSubmission(submissionId)` or `listSubmissions()` to inspect status.

## API

```typescript
const submission = await this.submitMessages(messages, {
  submissionId: "optional-stable-id",
  idempotencyKey: "external-job-id",
  metadata: { source: "webhook" }
});
```

`submitMessages()` accepts serializable `UIMessage[]` values. It does not accept
the function form supported by `saveMessages((messages) => ...)`, because
durable submissions persist work before execution and cannot store closures.
The array must contain at least one message.

## Statuses

| Status      | Meaning                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`   | Accepted and waiting for its turn              |
| `running`   | Claimed by the agent and executing             |
| `completed` | The Think turn completed successfully          |
| `aborted`   | The submission was cancelled                   |
| `skipped`   | Turn state was reset before the submission ran |
| `error`     | Execution failed or recovery was unsafe        |

## Idempotent retries

Pass an `idempotencyKey` from your external system. Retrying with the same key
returns the existing submission with `accepted: false` instead of inserting
duplicate messages:

```typescript
const first = await this.submitMessages(messages, {
  idempotencyKey: payload.id
});

const retry = await this.submitMessages(messages, {
  idempotencyKey: payload.id
});

// retry.submissionId === first.submissionId
// retry.accepted === false
```

If you pass both `submissionId` and `idempotencyKey`, they must identify the same
submission. If they point at different existing rows, `submitMessages()` throws
instead of choosing one identity over the other.

## Inspect, list, and cancel

```typescript
const current = await this.inspectSubmission(submission.submissionId);

const active = await this.listSubmissions({
  status: ["pending", "running"]
});

await this.cancelSubmission(submission.submissionId, "No longer needed");
```

Use `cancelSubmission(submissionId)` for durable cancellation. This works across
Worker and Durable Object RPC boundaries, unlike `AbortSignal`.

Completed submission records are retained until you delete them:

```typescript
await this.deleteSubmissions({
  status: ["completed", "error", "aborted"],
  completedBefore: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
});
```

## Session behavior

Think stores accepted submissions in a submission ledger first. It appends the
submitted messages to the conversation `Session` only when the submission starts
executing. This preserves FIFO turn semantics: later accepted submissions are
not visible to the model until their own turn starts.

If you cancel a submission before its messages have been applied, including one
that has been claimed but is still waiting for its turn, those messages are not
persisted to the conversation.

If the chat is cleared or turn state is reset before a pending submission runs,
that submission is marked `skipped`.

## Compared with `saveMessages`

Use `saveMessages()` when the caller can wait for the full turn:

```typescript
const result = await this.saveMessages(messages);
// result.status is final
```

Use `submitMessages()` when timeout ambiguity would make retries unsafe:

```typescript
const result = await this.submitMessages(messages, { idempotencyKey });
// result.status is the accepted submission state
```

`waitUntilStable()` is still useful when the caller needs to avoid accepting new
work while the current chat UI is mid-turn. It is not required for durable
admission: accepted submissions are serialized by Think and do not append their
messages to the session until their own turn starts.

## Compared with Workflows

Use `submitMessages()` for one durable Think chat turn.

Use Workflows for multi-step orchestration: retries per step, long waits,
external events, human approvals, or pipelines that may trigger Think as one
part of a larger process.

Use `startFiber()` when the durable unit is agent-owned side-effect work around
a turn, such as accepting a webhook once, restoring a serialized chat thread,
and posting a visible reply. `submitMessages()` owns Think's message/session
admission; `startFiber()` owns the surrounding application job.

## Layering with `startFiber()`

Use the two APIs together when the external job is larger than the Think turn
itself:

```typescript
await this.startFiber(
  "reply-to-webhook",
  async (ctx) => {
    ctx.stash({ webhookId, threadId });

    const submission = await this.submitMessages(messages, {
      idempotencyKey: `turn:${webhookId}`,
      metadata: { threadId }
    });

    await postVisibleReply(threadId, submission.submissionId);
  },
  {
    idempotencyKey: `webhook:${webhookId}`,
    waitForCompletion: true
  }
);
```

The outer managed fiber answers: "Did this webhook job get accepted, recovered,
cancelled, or resolved?" The inner submission answers: "Did this Think turn get
admitted to the session and complete?" Keep those boundaries separate. Do not
replace Think's internal `chatRecovery` fibers with managed fibers unless the
work is an application-owned job that callers need to inspect or dedupe.

Workflows can compose with this API:

```typescript
const submission = await this.agent.submitMessages(messages, {
  idempotencyKey: event.payload.jobId
});
```
