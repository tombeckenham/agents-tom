# Runtime

The **Executor** is a simple, stateless sandbox: it runs a block of code once and dispatches tool calls back. The **Runtime** wraps an executor and makes execution durable.

**Why this exists:** approvals can take minutes or hours, and agents hibernate. A model may write a script that reads data, asks to create an issue, and continues after the user approves — possibly in a different request, after the Durable Object restarted. That needs durable state, which cannot live in the executor or in a single request. The runtime is where it lives.

The public runtime handle owns the executor and connectors for the current request. `CodemodeRuntime` is the DurableObject facet behind that handle. It owns the durable state: the tool-call log, pending approvals, and snippets.

## Configure

```ts
import {
  createCodemodeRuntime,
  DynamicWorkerExecutor
} from "@cloudflare/codemode";

const runtime = createCodemodeRuntime({
  ctx: this.ctx, // the agent's DurableObjectState
  executor: new DynamicWorkerExecutor({ loader: this.env.LOADER }),
  connectors: [github, repoApi]
});
```

| `runtime.saveSnippet(name, opts?)`                   | Promote an execution's script to a reusable [snippet](./snippets.md)                                                                       |
| `runtime.snippets()` / `runtime.deleteSnippet(name)` | List / remove saved snippets                                                                                                               |

`execute()`, `search()`, and `describe()` expose the same runtime to hosts that are not using the AI SDK. For example, an MCP server can register separate `search` and `execute` tools without reaching through `runtime.tool().execute` or duplicating connector discovery:

```ts
server.registerTool("search", searchOptions, async ({ query }) =>
  toMcpResult(await runtime.search(query))
);

server.registerTool("execute", executeOptions, async ({ code }) =>
  toMcpResult(await runtime.execute({ code }))
);
```

Search and describe results mark methods with `requiresApproval: true` when their connector annotation requires it.

## The sandbox API (`codemode.*`)

The runtime also provides the model's API. Inside the sandbox, `codemode` is a global with four methods — discover, learn, do-once, reuse:

| Sandbox method               | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `codemode.search(query)`     | Ranked search across connector methods and saved snippets                |
| `codemode.describe(target)`  | TypeScript docs for a connector, method, or snippet — fetched on demand  |
| `codemode.step(name, fn)`    | Run a side-effectful or nondeterministic closure once; replay its result |
| `codemode.run(name, input?)` | Run a [snippet](./snippets.md) the developer saved                       |

Connector methods appear next to it as their own globals (`github.list_pull_requests(...)`).

**Why discovery lives in the sandbox:** the alternative is generating types for every tool and putting them all in the tool description, which floods the context as the tool count grows. `search` and `describe` return results **into the running code**, not into the prompt — the model pays for exactly the type information it asks for.

```ts
const matches = await codemode.search("pull request");
// { results: [{ path: "github.list_pull_requests", kind: "method", score: 145 }, ...], total, truncated }

const docs = await codemode.describe("github.list_pull_requests");
// { path, description, types: "type ListPullRequestsInput = { owner: string; ... }", kind: "method" }
```

`describe` works on a connector (`"github"`), a method (`"github.list_pull_requests"`), or a snippet name. Search ranks with executor-style matching: names are normalized (`camelCase`/`snake_case`/dots split into tokens), fields are scored by weight (path 12, method 10, connector 8, description 5) with bonuses for exact/prefix/phrase matches, and results are capped at 50 — when `truncated` is true the model should search again with a more specific query.

`codemode.step` is the explicit side-effect boundary that makes [abort-and-replay](#abort-and-replay) correct: the closure runs inside the sandbox, the result is recorded in the log, and on replay the closure is skipped.

```ts
const id = await codemode.step("gen-id", () => crypto.randomUUID());
const data = await codemode.step("fetch", async () =>
  (await fetch(url)).json()
);
```

## Executor vs Runtime

|          | Executor                                         | Runtime                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| What     | Code sandbox                                     | Durable execution engine                 |
| Lifetime | One `execute()` call                             | Whole conversation (DO facet)            |
| State    | None                                             | Tool-call log, pending actions, snippets |
| Examples | `DynamicWorkerExecutor`, `IframeSandboxExecutor` | `CodemodeRuntime`                        |

The executor runs code. The runtime wraps the executor and adds durability, approvals, rollback, and state.

## Abort and replay

The core mechanism. When the model's code runs, every tool call is recorded in a durable log:

1. **Read** (no annotation) → executes, result recorded in the log.
2. **Approval-required action** → recorded as `pending`, and the run **aborts**.
3. On **continue** → the same code re-runs. Every call already in the log is served from it (a noop replay — reads return their recorded result, applied actions return theirs). The newly-approved action executes for real. The run proceeds to the next pause or to completion.

```
run 1:  search() ──exec──> "results"        [logged: applied]
        list_prs() ──exec──> [pr1, pr2]      [logged: applied]
        create_issue() ──PAUSE──             [logged: pending]
        ✗ run aborts

user approves

run 2:  search() ──replay──> "results"       (from log, no re-exec)
        list_prs() ──replay──> [pr1, pr2]     (from log, no re-exec)
        create_issue() ──exec──> { number }   (approved, runs for real)
        post_comment() ──exec──> ok            (continues)
        ✓ run completes
```

The log is the replay spine. Everything — replay, rollback, audit — reads off it.

## Determinism requirement

Replay only works if the code is **deterministic up to tool calls**. The Nth tool call on run 1 must be the Nth tool call on run 2, with the same arguments. If the code branches on `Math.random()` or `Date.now()` in a way that changes which tools it calls — or passes nondeterministic values as arguments to an approval-gated action — replay diverges. The runtime detects this (the connector/method differs, or the stably-stringified arguments differ from the recorded call), records the execution as failed, and the tool returns an error result rather than throwing:

```ts
{
  status: "error",
  executionId: "exec_...",
  error: "Codemode replay divergence at step 2: arguments changed since the original run. Wrap nondeterministic work in codemode.step()."
}
```

Returning the divergence as data (instead of throwing across the RPC boundary) keeps the agent loop intact and lets the model self-correct. To make nondeterministic work replay-safe, wrap it in `codemode.step(name, fn)` so the value is captured once and replayed identically.

In practice, model-generated code is naturally deterministic — it fetches data, branches on the data (which is replayed identically), and calls tools. The constraint only bites if code uses nondeterministic sources to drive control flow or build action arguments.

**Issue tool calls sequentially.** The replay cursor assigns each call its sequence number when the call reaches the host, so `await a(); await b();` is stable across runs but `await Promise.all([a(), b()])` is not — the two calls can arrive in either order. On a run that never pauses this is harmless, but if such a run later pauses and resumes, the reordered calls trip divergence detection. Await connector calls one at a time in any run that might pause for approval.

## The tool-call log

```ts
type ToolLogEntry = {
  seq: number;
  connector: string;
  method: string;
  args: unknown;
  result?: unknown; // recorded for replay (never for ephemeral entries)
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  ephemeral?: boolean; // replay: "reexecute" — re-runs instead of replaying
  state: "executing" | "applied" | "pending" | "reverted";
};
```

A call is logged `executing` the moment the runtime decides to run it, and only flips to `applied` once its result is recorded. So a crash between those two points replays as a fresh execution (re-run) rather than replaying a missing result. Once a run pauses or terminates, every further call/step gets a pause decision and records nothing — model code that catches the pause and keeps going cannot apply extra effects.

The log lives in the facet's SQLite database — one row per entry, so recording a call appends a row instead of rewriting the whole execution.

The tool's output echoes the log on every outcome as `calls?: ToolLogEntry[]` (see [Tool output](./approvals.md#tool-output)), so a UI can render the run's audit trail directly from the tool result; `runtime.executions()` remains the durable source for past runs.

### Ephemeral entries

A tool can opt out of result recording with [`replay: "reexecute"`](./connectors.md#replay-policy). Its calls are still logged (for sequencing and divergence detection) but the result is never stored: a replay **re-executes** the call instead of replaying a recorded value. Use it for idempotent reads with large results — file contents, directory listings — that would otherwise bloat the durable log.

### Size limits

Any single recorded value (a call's arguments, a recorded result, the final result) is capped at 1 MB serialized (`MAX_DURABLE_VALUE_BYTES`). Truncating a logged value is never an option — replay would feed resumed code corrupted data — so an oversized argument or call result **fails the run** with a model-actionable error suggesting the data be written to a file/workspace and passed by reference. An oversized **final** result does not fail the run (replay never needs it): the run completes, the model receives the real value, and the audit trail stores a placeholder note.

## Rollback

Rollback walks the log backward and calls the `revert` of **every** applied action that has one — independent of `requiresApproval`. A non-approval write with a `revert` is still undone; an approval-gated action without a `revert` is not. `revert` (via `revertAction`) returns whether it actually reverted, and the runtime marks only those entries `reverted`:

```ts
protected tool(name: string, t: ConnectorTool): ConnectorTool {
  if (name === "create_issue") {
    return {
      ...t,
      requiresApproval: true,
      revert: async (_args, result) => {
        const { number } = result as { number: number };
        await this.closeIssue(number);
      }
    };
  }
  return t;
}
```

Tools without a `revert` are skipped (the user is told the action can't be auto-reverted). Reads are never reverted. `reject()` does **not** roll back — it only ends a paused execution (marking it `rejected`); call `rollback()` to undo actions already applied earlier in the run. Rollback attempts every revert even if one throws (failures are reported afterward rather than aborting the rest), and marks the execution `rolled_back` so the audit trail reflects that its effects were undone.

A terminal execution is one of `completed`, `error` (a thrown sandbox error or replay divergence), `rejected`, or `rolled_back`. These are exactly the statuses a connector's [`disposeExecution`](./connectors.md#per-execution-resources) hook fires for; `running` and `paused` are not terminal.

## Retention

The execution log is the audit trail, so it grows with every run. Terminal executions (completed or errored) are **auto-pruned** as new runs begin, keeping the newest `maxExecutions` (default 50). Running and paused executions are never pruned — an awaiting-approval run is always resumable.

```ts
const runtime = createCodemodeRuntime({
  ctx,
  executor,
  connectors,
  maxExecutions: 50 // cap on retained terminal executions
});

// Explicit controls
await runtime.executions(20); // newest first, optionally limited
await runtime.deleteExecution(id); // drop one (returns whether it existed)
await runtime.pruneExecutions(10); // keep only the newest N terminal runs
```

Because paused runs are exempt from pruning, an approval nobody ever answers would otherwise live forever — holding its log and any per-execution connector resources (a browser session, for example). `runtime.expirePaused({ maxAgeMs })` (default 24 hours) marks stale paused runs `rejected` and fires each connector's `disposeExecution`, reclaiming their resources. Call it from a recurring alarm or scheduled task:

```ts
// e.g. in a daily scheduled task
const expired = await runtime.expirePaused({ maxAgeMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 });
```

## Shaping results

A run's final result can be large enough to crowd the model's context. Pass `transformResult` to reshape the **model-facing** result of a completed run — most often to truncate it. It runs after the raw result is recorded, so the audit trail (`runtime.executions()`) keeps the full value while the model sees the shaped one. It applies on both the initial run and a resume after approval.

```ts
import { createCodemodeRuntime, truncateResult } from "@cloudflare/codemode";

const runtime = createCodemodeRuntime({
  ctx,
  executor,
  connectors,
  // Cap response size; small structured results pass through unchanged.
  transformResult: (result) => truncateResult(result)
});
```

`truncateResult(value, options?)` returns the value unchanged when its serialized size is within budget, and a truncated string (with a marker noting the original size) when it isn't. `truncateResponse(text, options?)` is the string-only variant. Both take `{ maxChars?, maxTokens? }` (default ~6000 tokens).

`transformResult` shapes only the final returned value — individual connector results inside the run are unaffected, so the model's own code still sees full data to reason over.

## Snippets

The runtime also stores [snippets](./snippets.md) — durable, addressable scripts the developer promotes with `runtime.saveSnippet(name)` and the model re-runs with `codemode.run(name)`. They live here because the runtime is the natural home for accumulated state (unlike the executor and connectors, which are transient).

## Runtime identity

The runtime facet's identity is an explicit **name** (default `"default"`):

```ts
const runtime = createCodemodeRuntime({
  ctx,
  executor,
  connectors,
  name: "research" // optional — distinct names keep separate histories
});
```

The connector set is **data, not identity**: adding, removing, or renaming a connector does not address a different runtime, so executions and snippets survive connector changes. Staleness is handled with recorded requirements instead — every execution and snippet records the connector names it ran with, and:

- **Resuming** a paused run whose recorded connectors are no longer configured returns a clear error outcome (instead of diverging confusingly mid-replay).
- **Running a snippet** (`codemode.run`) whose recorded connectors are missing returns an error explaining which connector is absent.

Use distinct names when two runtimes should not share history (for example, two unrelated tools on the same agent).

The runtime handle keeps the same `ctx`, `executor`, `connectors`, and `name` together, so lifecycle calls address the same durable facet:

```ts
const runtime = createCodemodeRuntime({ ctx, executor, connectors });
await runtime.pending();
await runtime.approve({ executionId });
await runtime.reject({ seq, executionId });
await runtime.rollback({ executionId });
```

## Why a facet

The runtime is a DurableObject facet of the agent because:

- The log, snippets, and state must survive hibernation — approvals can take minutes or hours.
- The facet is durable; the executor and connector stubs are transient and re-provided per message.
- One named runtime facet owns the whole execution lifecycle, with its own isolated SQLite database.
