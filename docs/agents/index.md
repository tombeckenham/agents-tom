# Agents Documentation

Build stateful AI agents on Cloudflare Workers. Every agent is a Durable Object — an addressable, hibernatable actor with its own SQLite database, WebSockets, and scheduling — so you can afford one durable agent per user, account, task, or conversation, with near-zero cost while idle.

## Choose your path

Pick the base class that matches what you are building. They share the same Durable Object foundation, so you can start small and move up without re-platforming.

Not sure? Start with [`Agent`](./agent-class.md) for raw building blocks, or [`Think`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/think/index.md) if you want a chat or reasoning agent that already handles the hard parts.

## What makes these production-grade

The differentiator is not "we have durable state" — it is what happens when a turn is interrupted. Agents built on this SDK keep their promises across Durable Object eviction, deploys, client disconnects, and human waits:

- **Turn recovery** — an in-flight LLM turn survives Durable Object eviction and resumes instead of silently dying. See [Chat & Fiber Recovery](./chat-agents.md#stream-recovery) and [Durable Execution](./durable-execution.md).
- **Resumable streams** — a disconnected client rejoins the same stream rather than losing the response. See [Resumable Streaming](./resumable-streaming.md).
- **Recovery-aware delivery** — Think snapshots channel delivery as `accepted`, `streaming`, or `completed`, so a restart replays a not-yet-streamed answer but posts a safe interruption notice rather than risking a duplicate partial reply. See [Messengers — Delivery and Recovery](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/think/messengers.md#delivery-and-recovery).
- **Durable submissions** — webhooks and RPC callers submit a turn with an idempotency key and check status later, instead of holding a request open. See [Programmatic Submissions](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/think/programmatic-submissions.md).
- **Human-in-the-loop without hangs** — a turn can pause for approval and resume later. A human wait is a first-class state, not a stuck request. See [Human in the Loop](./human-in-the-loop.md).
