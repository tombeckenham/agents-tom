![npm install agents](../../assets/npm-install-agents.svg)

**Build software that thinks and does.**

Persistent AI agents on Cloudflare's global network. They remember context, reason through problems, schedule their own work, and take action—all without you managing servers.

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template cloudflare/agents-starter
```

Or add to an existing project:

```sh
npm install agents
```

## Why Agents, Why Now

LLMs can reason, plan, and use tools—but they need infrastructure that matches their capabilities. Traditional serverless is stateless and ephemeral. Agents are persistent and purposeful.

```
From request handlers    →  to autonomous entities
From stateless functions →  to persistent intelligence

Traditional serverless:  Request → Response → Gone
Agents:                  Thinking, remembering, acting — continuously
```

**Pay only when active.** Agents hibernate between requests. You can have millions of agents—one per user, per session, per game room—each costs nothing when idle.

Built on Cloudflare Durable Objects, agents run globally, close to your users, with persistent state that survives restarts.

## Quick Example

A counter agent with real-time state sync and callable methods:

```typescript
// server.ts
import { Agent, callable } from "agents";

type State = { count: number };

export class CounterAgent extends Agent<Env, State> {
  initialState: State = { count: 0 };

  @callable()
  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    return this.state.count;
  }

  @callable()
  decrement() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });
    return this.state.count;
  }
}
```

```tsx
// client.tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const agent = useAgent<State>({
    agent: "counter-agent",
    name: "my-counter",
    onStateUpdate: (state) => setCount(state.count)
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => agent.stub.increment()}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => agent.stub.decrement()}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

State changes sync to all connected clients automatically. Call methods like they're local functions.

### State Management

State persists across requests and syncs to all connected clients:

```typescript
export class MyAgent extends Agent<Env, { items: string[] }> {
  initialState = { items: [] };

  @callable()
  addItem(item: string) {
    this.setState({ items: [...this.state.items, item] });
  }

  onStateChanged(state: State, source: Connection | "server") {
    // Called after state is persisted and broadcast
  }
}
```

### Callable Methods

Expose methods to clients with the `@callable()` decorator:

```typescript
@callable()
async processOrder(orderId: string, items: Item[]) {
  // Full type safety - clients call this like a local function
  const result = await this.validateAndProcess(orderId, items);
  return result;
}
```

```typescript
// Client
const result = await agent.stub.processOrder("order-123", items);
```

### Scheduling

Run tasks later, on intervals, or with cron expressions:

```typescript
// In 60 seconds
this.schedule(60, "sendReminder", { userId: "123" });

// Every hour
this.scheduleEvery(3600, "syncData");

// Daily at 9am UTC
this.schedule("0 9 * * *", "dailyReport");

// At a specific date
this.schedule(new Date("2025-12-31"), "yearEndTask");
```

### Background Tasks

Queue immediate background work:

```typescript
await this.queue("processUpload", { fileId: "abc" });
// Returns immediately, task runs in background
```

### Sub-agents

Spawn child Durable Objects (facets) from a parent agent. Each child has
its own SQLite storage and runs in parallel, but is addressed under the
parent's URL:

```typescript
export class Inbox extends Agent {
  @callable()
  async createChat() {
    const id = crypto.randomUUID();
    await this.subAgent(Chat, id);
    return id;
  }

  override async onBeforeSubAgent(_req, { className, name }) {
    if (!this.hasSubAgent(className, name)) {
      return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
    }
  }
}

export class Chat extends Agent {
  async writePreview(text: string) {
    const inbox = await this.parentAgent(Inbox);
    await inbox.savePreview(this.name, text);
  }
}
```

Client-side, connect to a child with `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`:

```tsx
const inbox = useAgent({ agent: "Inbox", name: userId });
const chat = useAgent({
  agent: "Inbox",
  name: userId,
  sub: [{ agent: "Chat", name: chatId }]
});
```

The routed URL becomes `/agents/inbox/{userId}/sub/chat/{chatId}`.

Child WebSocket clients can use the same URL shape. The parent remains the
public address, while child agents still receive `onConnect`, `onMessage`,
`onClose`, `broadcast()`, and `getConnections()` calls scoped to their own
clients. Parent broadcasts do not leak to child-targeted sockets, and child
connection tags, readonly state, and protocol-message settings are preserved
when a connection is resumed from hibernation.

Nested sub-agent URLs are supported using repeated `/sub/{agent}/{name}`
segments, subject to the platform's current facet nesting limits.

### Agent Tools

Run chat-capable sub-agents as tools from a parent chat agent. Think agents and
`AIChatAgent` subclasses are supported. The child keeps its own messages, tools,
SQLite storage, and resumable stream, while the parent broadcasts
`agent-tool-event` frames so the UI can render the child timeline inline.

```typescript
import { Think } from "@cloudflare/think";
import { agentTool } from "agents/agent-tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export class Researcher extends Think<Env> {
  getSystemPrompt() {
    return "Research the requested topic and end with a concise summary.";
  }
}

export class Assistant extends Think<Env> {
  getTools() {
    return {
      research: agentTool(Researcher, {
        description: "Research one topic in depth.",
        inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string().min(3) })
      })
    };
  }
}
```

For deterministic fan-out, call `this.runAgentTool(Researcher, { input })`
directly. Parent recovery reconciles stale child rows after restarts and marks
unrecoverable runs `interrupted` instead of hanging. In React, use
`useAgentToolEvents({ agent })` to render retained and replayed child timelines.
AIChatAgent children run headlessly, so browser client tools require a separate
bridge; server-side tools work normally. See the full
[Agent Tools guide](../../docs/agents/agent-tools.md).

### WebSocket Connections

Handle real-time communication:

```typescript
async onConnect(connection: Connection) {
  console.log(`Client ${connection.id} connected`);
}

async onMessage(connection: Connection, message: unknown) {
  // Handle incoming messages
  connection.send(JSON.stringify({ received: true }));
}

async onClose(connection: Connection) {
  console.log(`Client ${connection.id} disconnected`);
}
```

### Email

Agents can receive and respond to emails:

```typescript
async onEmail(email: EmailMessage) {
  const from = email.from;
  const subject = email.headers.get("subject");
  // Process incoming email
}
```

---

## Client SDK

### React

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<MyState | null>(null);

  const agent = useAgent<MyState>({
    agent: "my-agent",
    name: "instance-name",
    onStateUpdate: (newState) => setState(newState)
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>
      <button onClick={() => agent.stub.doSomething()}>Call Agent</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Vanilla JavaScript

```typescript
import { AgentClient } from "agents/client";

const client = new AgentClient({
  agent: "my-agent",
  name: "instance-name",
  onStateUpdate: (state) => console.log("State:", state)
});

// Call methods
const result = await client.call("processData", [payload]);

// Or use the stub
const result = await client.stub.processData(payload);
```

---

## Workflows Integration

For durable, multi-step tasks that survive failures and can pause for human approval, integrate with [Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/):

```typescript
import { AgentWorkflow } from "agents";

export class OrderWorkflow extends AgentWorkflow<OrderAgent, OrderParams> {
  async run(event, step) {
    // Step 1: Validate (retries automatically on failure)
    const validated = await step.do("validate", async () => {
      return validateOrder(event.payload);
    });

    // Step 2: Wait for human approval
    await this.reportProgress({ step: "approval", status: "pending" });
    const approval = await this.waitForApproval(step, { timeout: "7 days" });

    // Step 3: Process the approved order
    await step.do("process", async () => {
      return processOrder(validated, approval);
    });
  }
}
```

Workflows provide:

- **Durable execution** — steps retry automatically, state persists across failures
- **Human-in-the-loop** — pause for approval with `waitForApproval()`
- **Long-running tasks** — run for days or weeks
- **Progress tracking** — report status back to the agent

See [Workflows](../../docs/agents/workflows.md) and [Human in the Loop](../../docs/agents/human-in-the-loop.md).

## AI Chat Integration

For AI-powered chat experiences with persistent conversations, streaming responses, and tool support, see [`@cloudflare/ai-chat`](../ai-chat/README.md).

```typescript
import { AIChatAgent } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat";

export class ChatAgent extends AIChatAgent<Env> {
  async onChatMessage(onFinish) {
    return streamText({
      model: openai("gpt-4o"),
      messages: this.messages,
      tools: this.tools,
      onFinish
    });
  }
}
```

```tsx
// Client
import { useAgentChat } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat/react";

const { messages, input, handleSubmit } = useAgentChat({
  agent: useAgent({ agent: "chat-agent" })
});
```

Features:

- Automatic message persistence
- Resumable streaming (survives disconnections)
- Server and client-side tool execution
- Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive tools

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Agents integrate with MCP to act as servers (providing tools to AI assistants) or clients (using tools from other services).

### Creating a Stateless MCP server

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/server";
import { createMcpHandler } from "agents/mcp/server";
import { z } from "zod";

function createServer() {
  const server = new McpServer({ name: "my-tools", version: "1.0.0" });
  server.registerTool(
    "lookup",
    { description: "Look up data", inputSchema: { query: z.string() } },
    async ({ query }) => ({
      content: [{ type: "text", text: await lookup(query) }]
    })
  );
  return server;
}

export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return createMcpHandler(createServer)(request, env, ctx);
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler;
```

Use `McpAgent`, `createLegacyMcpHandler`, and `WorkerTransport` from
`agents/mcp` only when retaining Legacy session behavior.

### Using MCP Tools

```typescript
// Connect to external MCP servers
await this.addMcpServer(
  "weather-service",
  "https://weather-mcp.example.com/mcp",
  {
    transport: { type: "streamable-http" }
  }
);

// Use with AI SDK
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: this.mcp.getAITools(),
  prompt: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
});
```

---

## Configuration

Add your agent to `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "name": "MyAgent", "class_name": "MyAgent" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["MyAgent"] }]
}
```

Route requests to your agent:

```typescript
import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    return (
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ??
      new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
    );
  }
};
```
