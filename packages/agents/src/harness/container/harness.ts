/**
 * An agent CLI running in a Cloudflare Container, driven from a Durable
 * Object, behind the same interface as `PiHarness`: `harness.prompt()`,
 * `harness.sessions`, `harness.session(id)`.
 *
 * The harness does not know which agent runs in the container. A preset
 * (`claudeCode()`, `codex()`) says what to install and which adapter the
 * daemon runs; the harness builds the container from
 * `cloudflare/debian-trixie` on first use, installs the bundled daemon, and
 * snapshots the result, so there is no image to build. Credentials stay
 * outside: the CLI calls a placeholder host, and `ContainerEgress` adds the
 * real key. Any adapter that produces `ContainerEvent`s works, including
 * one in an image of your own (`containerAgent()`).
 *
 * The object owns the durable record, in a `HarnessStore`: sessions,
 * operations, the transcript, and the adapter's resume state. The container
 * is disposable. It is started on demand with `ctx.container.start()`, kept
 * for `idleTimeoutMs` after its last work, and then stopped. The next
 * prompt starts a new container and hands the adapter everything it
 * persisted, so the agent resumes its own session there.
 *
 * Each session has one Lifecycle wake job. It runs while the session has
 * open operations: it starts or reattaches to the container, reconciles
 * what the container knows with what the object stored, delivers queued
 * operations, and waits for them, rescheduling itself as a heartbeat. An
 * eviction mid-run leaves the job due, so its alarm restarts the object,
 * which reattaches and replays the frames it missed from its cursor.
 *
 * Recovery, by what was lost:
 *
 * - **The object** (eviction, deploy): the container keeps running for
 *   `idleTimeoutMs`. The wake reattaches and replays from the cursor.
 * - **The socket**: the same, on the next heartbeat.
 * - **The container** (idle stop, crash, platform restart): a new one
 *   answers with a different runtime id. The session is reopened in it
 *   from the persisted resume state; queued operations run there; an
 *   operation that was running is settled `container_lost` or run again,
 *   per `onContainerLost`.
 *
 * @experimental The API may change before it stabilizes.
