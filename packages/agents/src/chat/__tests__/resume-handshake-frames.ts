/**
 * Golden resume-handshake frames (rfc-chat-recovery-foundation, Tier-2).
 *
 * The byte-identical gate for extracting the shared resume-handshake module
 * (T2-2). The server-side REQUEST/ACK handlers in `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and
 * `@cloudflare/think` are byte-parallel: they emit the SAME outbound frame
 * shapes, differing only in the idle-connect payload, the outbound
 * use-chat-response constant, and the send/persist callbacks. These frozen
 * builders capture every outbound shape each branch emits, so the extracted
 * shared module must reproduce them exactly.
 *
 * Captured verbatim from the current handlers (pre-extraction):
 *  - ai-chat: `onMessage` `stream-resume-request` / `stream-resume-ack`
 *    (`index.ts` ~1062-1151), `_notifyStreamResuming` (~1341),
 *    `_replayTerminalOnResume` / `_replayTerminalOnAck` (~3896-3947).
 *  - think: `_handleStreamResumeRequest` / `_handleStreamResumeAck`
 *    (`think.ts` ~7470-7541), `_notifyStreamResuming` (~11176),
 *    `_replayTerminalOn*` (~11068-11114).
 *
 * Treat these builders as FROZEN. They model the exact bytes today's clients
 * parse; the T2-2 extraction asserts its shared module emits frames that
 * `toEqual` these, and any intended wire change must be a deliberate edit here
 * (paired with a client + changeset).
