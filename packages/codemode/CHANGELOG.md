## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1557](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1557) [`447013d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/447013d086d4f1728749bbca445c02d3dc5052c4) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add MCP SDK v2 client and server support. `MCPClientConnection` now uses the exact-pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.5`. It probes for stateless MCP with `server/discover`, then falls back to the legacy `initialize` handshake on the same connection when needed. The SDK auto-fulfills stateless elicitation `input_required` results through the existing form and URL elicitation handlers while `callTool`, `getPrompt`, and `readResource` remain pending. OAuth reauthorization discards redirect-scoped discovery after token issuance and preserves discovery-triggered authentication, allowing a changed authorization server to be rediscovered and registered without reusing the prior issuer's credentials. Legacy pushed elicitation, Streamable HTTP, SSE, RPC, OAuth, and hibernation recovery remain supported. Codemode's MCP connector now uses an SDK-neutral structural boundary compatible with both MCP client generations.

  Add MCP SDK v2 support to `createMcpHandler`. Pass a factory returning `McpServer` or `Server` from the exact-pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0-beta.5` peer dependency to serve stateless MCP with legacy compatibility by default. The new `agents/mcp/server` entry exports the stateless Agents handler without retaining `McpAgent`, `WorkerTransport`, MCP client transports, PartyServer, or SDK v1 modules. The returned handler remains callable for Worker dispatch and exposes the lower-level SDK `fetch(request, options?)` method plus typed `notify` methods; upstream `close` and event-bus internals are not part of the Agents surface. The retained v1 server APIs use the exact-pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` peer dependency.

  The legacy compatibility fallback now uses SDK v2's web-standard transport, including fail-fast handling for unsupported server-to-client requests, active-request teardown, and the same 25-second Cloudflare SSE keepalive previously supplied by `WorkerTransport`. It returns `405` for session-only GET and DELETE requests without constructing an application server. `createLegacyMcpHandler` remains an explicit public API for SDK v1 servers and complete WorkerTransport options.

  The MCP client storage codec now preserves stateless discovery data with resumed HTTP sessions and preserves the binding name and props required to restore RPC servers. Stored HTTP session IDs from older Agents versions have no associated protocol version. The upgraded client discards those IDs and reconnects instead of sending an unsafe resumed request, so in-flight work tied to an old remote session does not resume.

  The v2 callable handler maps verified provider-issued metadata from compatible `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` releases to standard MCP `AuthInfo` while preserving `getMcpAuthContext().props`.

  The Workers handler rejects malformed, opaque, and non-HTTP browser Origins. Its default allowlist includes localhost-class Origins, the endpoint's `workers.dev` hostname, and a concrete `corsOptions.origin` hostname. It applies matching Host checks to localhost and `workers.dev` endpoints. Custom-domain deployments with wildcard CORS can set `allowedHostnames` and `allowedOriginHostnames` explicitly, or set `allowedOriginHostnames: "*"` when trusted upstream middleware already enforces the required Origin policy. Requests without Origin remain valid for non-browser MCP clients. Default CORS preflights allow the stateless `Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name` request headers.

  `@cloudflare/codemode` is now an optional peer. Applications that import `agents/skills` or `agents/browser` install Codemode explicitly; MCP-only applications no longer install it transitively.

  Deprecations in this release:

  - `McpAgent` is deprecated and feature-frozen as a stateful SDK v1 path. New servers should use an SDK v2 factory with `createMcpHandler` from `agents/mcp/server`.
  - Passing an SDK v1 server to the overloaded `createMcpHandler` is deprecated for removal in the next major release. Move the server to an SDK v2 factory. Use `createLegacyMcpHandler` only to temporarily retain sessionful SDK v1 behavior while migrating.
  - The explicit result-schema overloads `MCPClientManager.callTool(params, resultSchema, options)` and `withX402Client(...).callTool(confirm, params, resultSchema, options)` are deprecated. Use `callTool(params, options)` or `callTool(confirm, params, options)` instead.

  `experimental_createMcpHandler` was already deprecated and remains scheduled for removal in the next major release. Its warning now directs users to an SDK v2 factory first and names `createLegacyMcpHandler` only as a temporary bridge for sessionful SDK v1 behavior.

### Minor Changes

- [#1922](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1922) [`cb4c1c7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/cb4c1c722d5a556ce68228d8e60f9c1df604ef81) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Support both AI SDK v6 and v7.

  The `ai` peer range is `ai@^6 || ^7` (and `@ai-sdk/react` is `@^3 || ^4`) across
  `agents`, `@cloudflare/ai-chat`, `@cloudflare/codemode`, and `@cloudflare/think`.
  Consumers can adopt AI SDK v7 or stay on v6 — no forced AI SDK upgrade when
  bumping these packages.

  Only the current implementations are covered. New optimisations and APIs made
  available by AI SDK v7 (broader result-shape audits, stream helper migrations,
  etc.) are intentionally out of scope.

  How dual-version support works — `@cloudflare/think` calls the AI SDK through the
  option names present in both majors (v7 keeps the v6 names as aliases), and
  normalizes the genuine divergences at the boundary:

  - Uses `stepCountIs`, `system`, `experimental_telemetry`, `onStepFinish`, and
    `experimental_onToolCallFinish` (in v7 this alias resolves to
    `onToolExecutionEnd` and fires once).
  - The tool-execution-finished event is normalized across majors: v6's
    `{ success, output, error, durationMs, stepNumber }` and v7's
    `{ toolOutput, toolExecutionMs }` collapse to one `ToolCallResultContext`.
    `stepNumber` is `undefined` under v7 (the v7 event no longer provides it).
  - The UI message stream is built via the result's `toUIMessageStream()` method
    (present in both majors); the standalone `toUIMessageStream({ stream })`
    helper and `result.stream` are v7-only.
  - The workspace read tool emits `{ type: "file-data", data, mediaType, filename }`
    model output, accepted by both majors (v7's newer `{ type: "file", data: {
type: "data", data } }` shape does not exist in v6).

  Public API notes:

  - `@cloudflare/think` keeps `system`, `onStepFinish`, and `experimental_telemetry`
    where callers already use them, and also accepts `TurnConfig.telemetry`
    (forwarded ahead of `experimental_telemetry` when present).
  - `@cloudflare/ai-chat` updates the `AIChatAgent.onChatMessage` callback type
    from `StreamTextOnFinishCallback` to `GenerateTextOnFinishCallback`.

  Verified against both `ai@6` and `ai@7`: `@cloudflare/think` type-checks with
  zero errors and its full workers test suite passes under each major.

  Known limitations:

  - `workers-ai-provider` (Think's default model provider) is fixed at v4 for AI
    SDK v7. Consumers on `ai@6` who rely on Think's built-in default model may hit
    a provider-version mismatch; passing their own `LanguageModel` avoids this.
  - `chat@4.31.0` currently declares an `ai@^6` peer and does not yet advertise
    v7 support; tracked separately.
  - CI should exercise both an `ai@6` and an `ai@7` resolution to guard the matrix.

- [#1969](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1969) [`80ad8de`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/80ad8deecfe9606d8ef1d505ad0115bbdb8e7073) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add framework-neutral `execute`, `search`, and `describe` methods to the durable Code Mode runtime handle so MCP servers and other non-AI-SDK hosts can invoke execution and discovery directly. Search and describe results now identify methods that require approval.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1904](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1904) [`88f7f69`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/88f7f69df92de9b36987980be1091056d1557b29) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Echo the durable tool-call log on the proxy tool output. `ProxyToolOutput` now carries an optional `calls` field (the execution's `ToolLogEntry[]`) on completed, paused and error outcomes, so UIs can render an audit trail of every connector call and step — name, args, result, approval requirement and state — without a separate `executions()` round trip.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1807](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1807) [`7eea2fb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7eea2fb9e0f278b227b5f419b847e6882d3ef9b1) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Cleanup connector imports so connector modules are imported normally and the Vite plugin only auto-exports the CodemodeRuntime facet class. Codemode now fails loudly when the runtime facet class is not exported from the Worker entry.

- [#1814](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1814) [`a79144d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a79144d7b47efc85afa3665dc68f4b5ab8a9aad4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Dispose the dynamically-loaded Worker and its RPC entrypoint stub after each
  `DynamicWorkerExecutor.execute()` run.

  Each execution spins up a child Worker via `loader.load()` and obtains an RPC
  `Fetcher` stub via `getEntrypoint()`. These own native handles, and the code
  previously left them for the garbage collector. When such a handle is finalized
  late — for example during isolate shutdown under
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` — workerd raises a fatal assertion ("tried to
  defer destruction during isolate shutdown") that kills the worker, surfacing as
  a flaky "Worker exited unexpectedly" with no failing assertion. The milder
  manifestation is workerd's "An RPC result was not disposed properly" warning.

  The executor now disposes the entrypoint stub and the loaded worker in `finally`
  blocks (best-effort, via `Symbol.dispose`), releasing the handles while the
  isolate is still alive. No behavior or API change for callers.

- [#1793](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1793) [`247ebeb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/247ebeb1fe34bd3b07a03530485e4597592e5ecc) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Pass the outer MCP tool-call context to `openApiMcpServer` request callbacks so server-to-client requests and notifications can be associated with the originating response stream.

- [#1791](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1791) [`9c85369`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/9c85369a3f8bcfc0a2c4c3a559623cb5943c5fdd) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Remove the root entry's runtime dependency on the optional `ai` and `zod` peers. Executor and runtime imports now bundle without either framework package installed.

- [#1772](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1772) [`d4f27fe`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d4f27fededefebc17cf455218e952ff76ade847b) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Include each package's documentation in its published package.

- [#1806](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1806) [`43f663d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/43f663d2245fc5c74d0c41d0ada0d7b7da700c12) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Increase the default DynamicWorkerExecutor timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds to better support longer-running codemode executions.

### Patch Changes

- [#1760](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1760) [`6769830`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/676983019be59cc96e2faaca6f1551a0cb3caa08) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Fix the runtime tool description to say "Execute JavaScript" instead of "Execute TypeScript". The codemode sandbox executes JavaScript only; TypeScript types are generated for LLM context but are not executed.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1581](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1581) [`b2b6762`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b2b67623deab327042b99344d8ee530ae37a71b2) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add the connector model and a durable runtime for codemode.

  **Connectors** — class-based integrations that bridge external services into the sandbox. A connector is three things: `name()`, optional `instructions()`, and `tools()` — one record, one entry per tool, with each tool carrying its own description, schema, `requiresApproval`, `execute`, and optional `revert`:
  - `CodemodeConnector` — abstract base; author `tools()` directly (AI SDK toolsets are shape-compatible and can be returned as-is). Its constructor accepts a `DurableObjectState` or an `ExecutionContext`, so you pass `this.ctx` from inside an Agent/DO with no cast.
  - `McpConnector` — derives `tools()` from an MCP connection (`createConnection()`); decorate derived tools via the `tool(name, t)` hook
  - **Per-execution resources** — a tool's `execute(args, ctx)`/`revert(args, result, ctx)` now receive the run's `executionId` (stable across pause/resume), and connectors can override `disposeExecution(executionId, status)` to tear down a resource scoped to one run (a browser/CDP session, a transaction). It fires on each terminal transition (`completed`/`error`/`rejected`/`rolled_back`) and **never on pause**, so a resource survives an approval pause and is released when the run truly ends. Must be idempotent (a completed-then-rolled-back run disposes twice). A stale/no-op `reject` no longer triggers teardown, so a still-resumable run keeps its resources
  - `OpenApiConnector` — derives one typed tool **per operation** from the spec (host-side, zero prompt tokens), so the model calls `api.get_repository({ owner, repo })` directly; `request()` remains as a low-level escape hatch. Derivation resolves local `$ref`s (including `allOf`/`oneOf`/`anyOf`) and is memoized by spec identity, so a static spec is parsed once even though connectors are reconstructed per message; operations whose names collide (or hit the reserved `request`/`spec`) are skipped with a warning

  **Runtime** — `CodemodeRuntime`, a DurableObject facet that wraps an `Executor` and makes execution durable via abort-and-replay:
  - Every tool call and `codemode.step(name, fn)` is recorded in a durable log
  - Reads and steps execute and record their result
  - Approval-required actions pause the run (abort)
  - The facet is **stateless across calls** — execution id + a host-allocated sequence + the approval requirement are threaded into every call, so runs are safe across hibernation and can run concurrently without clobbering one another
  - Once a run pauses or terminates, the facet **refuses further progress**: every subsequent call/step gets a pause decision and records nothing, so model code that catches the pause sentinel and keeps going can't drive extra side effects
  - A decided-but-not-yet-recorded call is logged as `executing` (not `applied`), so a crash between deciding and recording the result **re-executes on replay** instead of replaying `undefined`
  - **Replay divergence** (a call's connector/method or its arguments differ from the recorded run, e.g. nondeterminism not wrapped in `codemode.step`) is detected and recorded as a failed execution
  - Execution outcomes are **returned, not thrown**: the tool yields `{ status: "completed" | "paused" | "error" }` so a sandbox error or divergence is an observable tool result rather than an exception that breaks the agent loop
  - Lifecycle calls target an **explicit `executionId`** — there is no implicit "current run" (a single shared pointer would be racy with concurrent runs). Every tool outcome (`completed`/`paused`/`error`) carries `executionId`, and `pending()`/`executions()` surface ids for approval UIs
  - `runtime.pending()` lists actions awaiting approval, for approval UIs — with no `executionId` it **aggregates across all paused runs** (not just the most recent); `runtime.executions()` lists all runs (the audit trail)
  - `runtime.approve({ executionId })` replays the log and runs the approved action; it only resumes a **paused** run — approving a run that already completed, was rejected, or rolled back (a stale/racing approval UI) is a safe no-op that revives nothing (returning an error outcome) rather than re-offering a rejected action or re-applying rolled-back effects. `runtime.reject({ seq, executionId })` ends the execution with a first-class `rejected` status (it does **not** auto-undo already-applied actions — call `rollback()` for that)
  - `runtime.rollback({ executionId })` reverts **all** applied, reversible actions (any tool with a `revert`, not just approval-gated ones) in reverse order, marking only those actually reverted; it attempts every revert even if one fails (surfacing the failures afterward) and marks the execution `rolled_back`
  - **Retention** — terminal executions are auto-pruned to `maxExecutions` (default 50) as new runs begin; `runtime.deleteExecution(id)` and `runtime.pruneExecutions(keep)` are explicit controls. Running/paused executions are never pruned.
  - `codemode.step(name, fn)` is the explicit side-effect boundary — wrap any nondeterministic or side-effectful work so it runs once and replays thereafter
  - The runtime facet's identity is **derived from the connector set** — changing connectors yields a fresh runtime, so stored snippets and paused executions are always bound to the connectors that can run them

  **Snippets** — durable, addressable saved scripts that replace the old static skills. The model writes and runs scripts; the developer promotes the good ones with `runtime.saveSnippet(name, { executionId?, description })` and the model re-runs them with `codemode.run(name, input)`. Snippets live on the runtime, surface in `codemode.search`/`describe`, and are structurally bound to the connector set (no per-snippet dependency tracking).

  **Runtime-facing tool** — `createCodemodeRuntime({ ctx, executor, connectors }).tool()` returns one `{ code }` tool. Inside the sandbox: `codemode.search/describe/step/run` plus `<connector>.<method>(...)` globals — a deliberately minimal surface: discover, learn, do-once, reuse.

  **Result shaping** — `createCodemodeRuntime` accepts an optional `transformResult` that reshapes the **model-facing** result of a completed run (initial run and resume), after the raw value is recorded — so the audit trail keeps the full result while the model sees the shaped one. Exported `truncateResult`/`truncateResponse` (with `{ maxChars?, maxTokens? }`) are the default building blocks: structured results pass through unchanged until oversized, then serialize to a bounded, marked string.

  `ResolvedProvider` gains an optional `prelude` — sandbox-side JS that can define real in-sandbox functions on a namespace (used to implement `codemode.step`, which wraps a local closure that can't cross the RPC boundary). New exported types `ToolExecuteContext` and `ExecutionEndStatus` describe the per-execution resource contract.

  **Vite plugin** — `@cloudflare/codemode/vite` discovers `*.codemode.ts` files and auto-exports connector classes for `ctx.exports` access.

  Executor-style ranked search with normalized tokenization and scoring.

- [#1656](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1656) [`4c2d1a7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c2d1a7f7f337bf426b0b35e3c9e8e4901c6360b) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Codemode runtime refinements (pre-release):
  - **SQL storage.** The `CodemodeRuntime` facet now stores executions, the tool-call log, and snippets in SQLite tables (one row per log entry) instead of single key-value blobs — appends no longer rewrite the whole execution, and pruning/expiry/listing are indexed. Args/results are serialized with a binary- and bigint-safe codec.
  - **Size guards.** Any single recorded value (call args, a recorded result, the final result) is capped at 1 MB serialized (`MAX_DURABLE_VALUE_BYTES`). Oversized args or call results fail the run with a model-actionable error; an oversized final result completes normally with a placeholder in the audit trail.
  - **Replay policy.** Connector tools can declare `replay: "reexecute"`: the call is logged for sequencing/divergence but its result is never stored — replays re-execute it. For idempotent reads with large results. Incompatible with `requiresApproval`.
  - **`onPassEnd` hook.** Connectors get `onPassEnd(executionId, status)` at the end of every execution pass — including pauses, where `disposeExecution` deliberately does not fire — to release per-pass resources (sockets, leases).
  - **Explicit runtime identity.** The runtime facet is keyed by an explicit `name` (default `"default"`) instead of a fingerprint of the connector set, so executions and snippets survive connector changes. Each execution/snippet records the connector names it needs; resume and `codemode.run` verify them and fail with a clear error when one is missing.
  - **`expirePaused`.** `runtime.expirePaused({ maxAgeMs })` (default 24h) expires stale non-terminal runs and fires `disposeExecution`, reclaiming their resources — for use from a recurring alarm/scheduled task. Paused (awaiting-approval) runs are marked rejected; runs stuck `running` after a host crash are marked errored (they could never be resumed or pruned otherwise).
  - **Lifecycle hardening.** `runtime.reject()` returns whether it actually terminated the run (`false` for a stale/duplicate reject — e.g. the action was approved from another tab) so callers never report a run as rejected when its gated action actually executed. `deleteExecution` on a non-terminal run also disposes its per-execution connector resources. Oversized execution code is rejected up front with a model-actionable error, and snippet schemas are size-checked on save. `createCodemodeRuntime` rejects duplicate connector names (they would silently shadow each other in the sandbox).
  - **Reserved-name hardening.** The executor rejects provider/connector names that would shadow harness globals (`Promise`, `setTimeout`, `Error`, `console`, …).
  - **Anti-hallucination tool description.** The default execute tool description now states explicitly that the connector namespaces plus `codemode` are the only sandbox globals (no `host`, `fs`, `require`, `process`), and tells the model to discover method names via `codemode.search` instead of guessing. `tool({ connectorHints })` renders a one-line usage hint next to each connector in the description. A sandbox `ReferenceError` (`x is not defined`) now gets the list of available globals appended, so the model's retry is informed.

- [#1656](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1656) [`4c2d1a7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c2d1a7f7f337bf426b0b35e3c9e8e4901c6360b) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Add `ToolSetConnector` — adapt an AI SDK `ToolSet` into a codemode connector.

  `toolSetConnector(ctx, { tools })` (default name `tools`) turns existing AI SDK tools into connector tools for the durable runtime, converting their input schemas to JSON Schema for the sandbox type declarations. Tools with `needsApproval: true` are mapped to `requiresApproval: true` on the connector tool — calling one pauses the execution durably for human approval instead of the tool being unavailable. Tools without an `execute` function (client-side / provider-executed) are excluded from both the bindings and the generated types, with a one-time warning — the sandbox can't call them. The runtime tool's description now also instructs the model to stop and wait when an execution returns `status: "paused"`.

- [#1181](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1181) [`e9bace9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e9bace967dbf3a79e5d873142f6530ad79c8b456) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `createCodeTool` dropping `positionalArgs` from providers, causing multi-argument tool calls (e.g. `stateTools`) to silently lose arguments after the first.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1138](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1138) [`36e2020`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/36e2020d41d3d8a83b65b7e45e5af924b09f82ed) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Drop Zod v3 from peer dependency range — now requires `zod ^4.0.0`. Replace dynamic `import("ai")` with `z.fromJSONSchema()` from Zod 4 for MCP tool schema conversion, removing the `ai` runtime dependency from the agents core. Remove `ensureJsonSchema()`.

### Patch Changes

- [#1149](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1149) [`47ce125`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/47ce125e36e3c892fdb702a626af1f62b0a247e7) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: add TanStack AI integration (`@cloudflare/codemode/tanstack-ai`)

  New entry point for using codemode with TanStack AI's `chat()` instead of the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText()`.

  ```typescript
  import {
    createCodeTool,
    tanstackTools
  } from "@cloudflare/codemode/tanstack-ai";
  import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";

  const codeTool = createCodeTool({
    tools: [tanstackTools(myServerTools)],
    executor
  });

  const stream = chat({ adapter, tools: [codeTool], messages });
  ```

  **Exports:**
  - `createCodeTool` — returns a TanStack AI `ServerTool` (via `toolDefinition().server()`)
  - `tanstackTools` — converts a `TanStackTool[]` into a `ToolProvider` with pre-generated types
  - `generateTypes` — generates TypeScript type definitions from TanStack AI tools
  - `resolveProvider` — re-exported framework-agnostic provider resolver

  **Internal cleanup:** extracted `resolveProvider` into a framework-agnostic `resolve.ts` module so the main entry (`@cloudflare/codemode`) no longer pulls in the `ai` package at runtime. Shared constants and helpers moved to `shared.ts` to avoid duplication between the AI SDK and TanStack AI entry points.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1122](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1122) [`a16e74d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a16e74db106a5f498e1710286023f4acfbb322be) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `ToolProvider` interface for composing tools from multiple sources into a single codemode sandbox. `createCodeTool` now accepts a `ToolProvider[]` alongside raw tool sets. Each provider contributes tools under a named namespace (e.g. `state.*`, `mcp.*`) with the default being `codemode.*`. Providers with `positionalArgs: true` use natural function signatures (`state.readFile("/path")`) instead of single-object args. The old `executor.execute(code, fns)` signature is deprecated but still works with a warning.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1114](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1114) [`5d88b81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/5d88b810cda4edc4f55ea6bc619a376efa9b8f4d) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add `@cloudflare/codemode/mcp` barrel export with two functions:
  - `codeMcpServer({ server, executor })` — wraps an MCP server with a single `code` tool where each upstream tool becomes a typed `codemode.*` method
  - `openApiMcpServer({ spec, executor, request })` — creates `search` + `execute` MCP tools from an OpenAPI spec with host-side request proxying and automatic `$ref` resolution

- [#1113](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1113) [`1264372`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/1264372999698d63b81bab79426c6e6f409585d5) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add optional `modules` option to `DynamicWorkerExecutorOptions` to allow injecting custom ES modules into the sandbox

- [#1117](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1117) [`9837adc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/9837adc9267f2508d574fb329786bb51c8c3a61c) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - DynamicWorkerExecutor now normalizes code and sanitizes tool names internally. Users no longer need to call `normalizeCode()` or `sanitizeToolName()` before passing code/fns to `execute()`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1102](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1102) [`f07ef51`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f07ef51e163364570f5fbfa9e5c867b13634c6a7) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - **BREAKING:** `generateTypes` and `ToolDescriptor`/`ToolDescriptors` types are no longer exported from the main entry point. Import them from `@cloudflare/codemode/ai` instead:

  ```ts
  // Before
  import { generateTypes } from "@cloudflare/codemode";

  // After
  import { generateTypes } from "@cloudflare/codemode/ai";
  ```

  The main entry point (`@cloudflare/codemode`) no longer requires the `ai` or `zod` peer dependencies. It now exports:
  - `sanitizeToolName` — sanitize tool names into valid JS identifiers
  - `normalizeCode` — normalize LLM-generated code into async arrow functions
  - `generateTypesFromJsonSchema` — generate TypeScript type definitions from plain JSON Schema (no AI SDK needed)
  - `jsonSchemaToType` — convert a JSON Schema to a TypeScript type declaration string
  - `DynamicWorkerExecutor`, `ToolDispatcher` — sandboxed code execution
  - `JsonSchemaToolDescriptor` / `JsonSchemaToolDescriptors` — types for the JSON Schema API

  The `ai` and `zod` peer dependencies are now optional — only required when importing from `@cloudflare/codemode/ai`.

## 0.1.3

- [#1074](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1074) [`33b92d5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/33b92d5264c62528d2a66d424c4b3d012ec9d648) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Remove `zod-to-ts` dependency to reduce bundle size. Zod schemas are now converted to TypeScript strings via JSON Schema using the existing `jsonSchemaToTypeString()` function and AI SDK's `asSchema()`.

  - Add depth and circular reference guards to prevent stack overflows on recursive or deeply nested schemas
  - Add `$ref` resolution for internal JSON Pointers (`#/definitions/...`, `#/$defs/...`, `#`)
  - Add tuple support (`prefixItems` for JSON Schema 2020-12, array `items` for draft-07)
  - Add OpenAPI 3.0 `nullable: true` support across all schema branches
  - Fix string escaping in enum/const values, property names (control chars, U+2028/U+2029), and JSDoc comments (`*/`)
  - Add per-tool error isolation in `generateTypes()` so one malformed schema cannot crash the pipeline
  - Guard missing `inputSchema` in `getAITools()` with a fallback to `{ type: "object" }`
  - Add per-tool error isolation in `getAITools()` so one bad MCP tool does not break the entire tool set

- [#961](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/961) [`f6aa79f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f6aa79f3bf86922db73b4d33439262aefcbcf817) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Updated default tool prompt to explicitly request JavaScript code from LLMs, preventing TypeScript syntax errors in the Dynamic Worker executor.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#879](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/879) [`90e54da`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/90e54dab21f7c2c783aac117693918765e8b254b) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Remove experimental_codemode() and CodeModeProxy. Replace with createCodeTool() from @cloudflare/codemode/ai which returns a standard AI SDK Tool. The package no longer owns an LLM call or model choice. Users call streamText/generateText with their own model and pass the codemode tool.

  The AI-dependent export (createCodeTool) is now at @cloudflare/codemode/ai. The root export (@cloudflare/codemode) contains the executor, type generation, and utilities which do not require the ai peer dependency.

  ToolDispatcher (extends RpcTarget) replaces CodeModeProxy (extends WorkerEntrypoint) for dispatching tool calls from the sandbox back to the host. It is passed as a parameter to the dynamic worker's evaluate() method instead of being injected as an env binding, removing the need for CodeModeProxy and globalOutbound service bindings. Only a WorkerLoader binding is required now. globalOutbound on DynamicWorkerExecutor defaults to null which blocks fetch/connect at the runtime level. New Executor interface (execute(code, fns) => ExecuteResult) allows custom sandbox implementations. DynamicWorkerExecutor is the Cloudflare Workers implementation. Console output captured in ExecuteResult.logs. Configurable execution timeout.

  AST-based code normalization via acorn replaces regex. sanitizeToolName() exported for converting MCP-style tool names to valid JS identifiers.
