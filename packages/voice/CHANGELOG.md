## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1912](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1912) [`219d59b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/219d59b8524868a9e258ebc3c437618b25e739a1) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Add AssemblyAI and ElevenLabs streaming STT providers for the voice pipeline.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1909](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1909) [`63491bd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/63491bdff0457118ea13139142d2578e5474fd99) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Honor the configured sample rate for raw `pcm16` audio payloads.

  Adds a `sampleRate` option to `VoiceAgentOptions` (default `16000`) that is declared in the server `audio_config` message. `VoiceClient` reads it (exposed via a new `sampleRate` getter) and constructs `AudioBuffer` instances at that rate for raw `pcm16` playback, so providers with a native rate other than 16 kHz (e.g. 24 kHz Gemini TTS) play at the correct speed. Falls back to 16 kHz when the server omits the field.

- [#1891](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1891) [`d1cc317`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d1cc317516878c640438de00b854786381a2b08e) Thanks [@korinne](https://github.com/korinne)! - Add transcriber readiness so voice agents wait for streaming STT startup before entering listening state or running call-start hooks.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1605](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1605) [`8bfebf0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/8bfebf00220879bf7c2c3904542df0fcb15fa0b6) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Support AI SDK fullStream responses in voice turns and warn when textStream is used.

- [#1772](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1772) [`d4f27fe`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d4f27fededefebc17cf455218e952ff76ade847b) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Include each package's documentation in its published package.

- [#1816](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1816) [`f18ff01`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f18ff0123439e30411f92dbb1d1565682eadf428) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Fix assistant speech playing back slow on a new turn after an idle gap. `VoiceClient` routes playback through a `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode` -> `HTMLAudioElement` bridge, and reusing that element for a fresh burst after it had been idle between turns made the new turn resume at the wrong rate (audible as slow-motion that re-converges to normal over the turn). The bridge is now torn down and rebuilt once it has fully drained and been idle past a short threshold, so each turn plays through a freshly created element. Rebuilds never happen mid-turn, since chunks within a turn keep at least one source scheduled on the playback cursor.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1747](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1747) [`28653b3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/28653b30b5e89592915a3b1e08d3b536c16c18ba) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Fix audible clicks at audio chunk boundaries during agent speech. `VoiceClient` played each response chunk by starting it at `currentTime` and waiting for its `ended` event before scheduling the next, so every chunk seam carried a few milliseconds of silence (event-loop latency plus the next chunk's setup) — audible as a periodic click, roughly one per chunk. Chunks are now scheduled back-to-back on the audio clock via a playback cursor (`start(Math.max(currentTime, cursor))`), so consecutive chunks butt together sample-tight. Because chunks can now be scheduled ahead of playback, the client tracks every scheduled source and stops them all on interrupt/end-call (previously only the single active source needed stopping), and playback counts as active until the last scheduled chunk finishes so barge-in detection keeps working through the scheduled tail.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1754](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1754) [`151d457`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/151d457d320fccc9852fccbf168edfc54d72d9a3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Stop fire-and-forget voice lifecycle handlers from leaking unhandled rejections
  on connection teardown. The `withVoiceInput` mixin dispatches `start_call`,
  `end_call`, `interrupt`, and transcript emission from the synchronous
  `onMessage` handler without awaiting them, so a client dropping mid-operation
  (e.g. while `keepAlive()`'s alarm write is still in flight) could surface a
  retryable "Network connection lost." rejection. These background tasks now run
  through a teardown-aware helper that swallows expected connection-teardown
  errors and logs anything unexpected.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1711](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1711) [`a3a8d83`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a3a8d8357b5043a726e04fd911acdf0dbd20f271) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Add `outputDeviceId` and `setOutputDevice()` for routing assistant playback to a selected audio output device when the browser supports sink selection.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1568](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1568) [`c7649ac`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c7649aceb870ba60a8a6dd55933272d043daa944) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Avoid emitting empty assistant transcript entries when a voice turn produces no response text.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1478](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1478) [`2c7d91b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/2c7d91b7dd2aed73b1871f72b79e6e59b89e2ce8) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Add an `enabled` option to `useVoiceAgent` so React apps can delay creating and connecting a `VoiceClient` until async prerequisites such as capability tokens are ready.

### Patch Changes

- [#1458](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1458) [`84cb429`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/84cb429f7f41becc5e6ff0592f0308c52a5134f1) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Fix Workers AI STT session edge cases for Flux and Nova 3.

  Flux now preserves the latest non-empty turn transcript from turn lifecycle events so an `EndOfTurn` event with an empty `transcript` can still emit the completed utterance. Flux `StartOfTurn` also drives server-side barge-in so model-detected user speech aborts active LLM/TTS playback promptly. Nova 3 now defensively normalizes finalized segment state before reading it to avoid stale teardown messages throwing during abnormal close paths.

- [#1462](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1462) [`5f6214d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/5f6214dccfe3ba9bf243ec15d291b37b9659a54c) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Fix `withVoice` text streaming for AI SDK `textStream` responses so TTS audio is produced when `onTurn()` returns `streamText(...).textStream` directly.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`ca510d4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/ca510d4fecbecb07d0d3cdad7d78c32cc226275e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Tighten the `agents` peer dependency floor from `>=0.9.0` to `>=0.11.7` to reflect the current monorepo set we actually test against. Upper bound (`<1.0.0`) is unchanged.

  No runtime change in `@cloudflare/voice` itself. The visible effect for consumers: pairing the latest `@cloudflare/voice` with a stale `agents` (`<0.11.7`) now produces a peer warning where it previously did not. That's the intended signal — `agents` versions older than 0.11.7 are no longer tested against this `@cloudflare/voice`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1313](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1313) [`08da191`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/08da191ab66d2df5de7337a295d5f6a081473ff9) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Publish with correct peer dependency ranges for `agents` (wide ranges were being overwritten to tight `^0.x.y` by the pre-publish script)

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1310](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1310) [`bd0346e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/bd0346ec05406e258b3c8904874c7a8c0f4608e5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix peer dependency ranges for `agents` — published packages incorrectly had tight `^0.10.x` ranges instead of the intended `>=0.8.7 <1.0.0` / `>=0.9.0 <1.0.0`, causing install warnings with `agents@0.11.0`. Also changed `updateInternalDependencies` from `"patch"` to `"minor"` in changesets config to prevent the ranges from being overwritten on future releases.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1293](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1293) [`16769b0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/16769b0bbf92ee6dab0293957b2a9b7d340e567a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Switch to per-call continuous STT sessions. Breaking API change.

  The transcriber session is now created at `start_call` and lives for the entire call duration. The model handles turn detection — no client-side `start_of_speech`/`end_of_speech` required for STT. Voice agents use `keepAlive` to prevent DO eviction during calls.

  New API:
  - `transcriber` property replaces `stt`, `streamingStt`, and `vad`
  - `createTranscriber(connection)` hook for runtime model switching
  - `WorkersAIFluxSTT` — per-call Flux sessions (recommended for `withVoice`)
  - `WorkersAINova3STT` — per-call Nova 3 streaming sessions (recommended for `withVoiceInput`)
  - `query` option on `VoiceClientOptions` — pass query params to the WebSocket URL (e.g. for model selection)
  - Throws at `start_call` if no transcriber is configured
  - Duplicate `start_call` is silently ignored when already in a call

  Removed:
  - `stt` (batch STT), `streamingStt` (per-utterance streaming), `vad` (server-side VAD)
  - `WorkersAISTT`, `WorkersAIVAD`, `pcmToWav`
  - `prerollMs`, `vadThreshold`, `vadPushbackSeconds`, `vadRetryMs`, `minAudioBytes` options
  - `VoiceInputAgentOptions` type
  - `beforeTranscribe` hook (audio is fed continuously, not in batches)
  - `vad_ms` and `stt_ms` from pipeline metrics
  - Hibernation support (`withVoice` and `withVoiceInput` now require `Agent`, not partyserver `Server`)

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [`c5ca556`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c5ca55618bd79042f566e55d1ebbe0636f91e75a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Replace wildcard `*` peer dependencies with real version ranges: `agents` to `>=0.9.0 <1.0.0` and `partysocket` to `^1.0.0`.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1198](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1198) [`dde826e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/dde826ec78f1714d9156d964d720507e3a139d8e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix TypeScript 6 declaration emit for `withVoice` and `withVoiceInput` mixin functions. TS6 enforces TS4094 which disallows `#private` members in exported anonymous class types. Added explicit return type interfaces (`VoiceAgentMixinMembers`, `VoiceInputMixinMembers`) so the generated `.d.ts` only exposes the public API surface.
