### Minor Changes

- [#2063](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/2063) [`3de6c8e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3de6c8ec3ad74b0c3809ed54e01359c570483532) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Remove the convention-driven Think framework, including the Vite plugin, generated Worker entry and virtual modules, CLI, Studio, framework helpers, and server-entry helpers. Remove the separate `create-think` scaffolder and its starter templates. Think remains available as an explicit runtime for hand-written Worker entries.

  **Migration for existing framework users**

  If you only use the `Think` runtime, React integration, messengers, workflows, extensions, or tools, no migration is required.

  | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@cloudflare/think/vite`                          | Use `agents/vite` for decorators and `agents:skills`, alongside `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`.                                                                                  |
  | `virtual:think/entry`                             | Add a real Worker entry, such as `src/server.ts`, that explicitly exports each Think class.                                                                                 |

  | `@cloudflare/think/server-entry`                  | Use Agents SDK routing helpers and application-owned request handlers.                                                                                                      |
  | `think types`                                     | Use `wrangler types`.                                                                                                                                                       |

  | `think studio`, `think state`, or `think inspect` | No direct replacement.                                                                                                                                                      |

  Existing deployments must preserve generated `ThinkAgent_*` and `ThinkSubAgent_*` constructor names and existing migration history. Sub-agent registries use `Class.name`, so export aliases alone do not preserve compatibility. If renaming classes, use a data-preserving Durable Object rename migration.

- [#2049](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/2049) [`ce0e608`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/ce0e608675e41794b02178dce0fb13bb62530aa8) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Preserve spacing between streamed text segments separated by tool calls. Think messenger delivery and Voice now share the same boundary-aware text joining logic from `agents/chat`.

  Existing users must:

  - Replace imports of `textDeltaFromStreamChunk()` from `@cloudflare/think/messengers` with `TextStreamCallback`, passing it the complete structured stream events.
  - Upgrade to `agents@0.21.0` when installing `@cloudflare/think@0.16.0` or `@cloudflare/voice@0.3.6`; both now require `agents >=0.20.2`.
  - Update exact-text expectations if they relied on segments around tool calls being concatenated without a space.

### Patch Changes

- [#2082](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/2082) [`9d35e81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/9d35e81e520065913c660cbb3863d971e5d1a501) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Emit workspace image reads as `image-data` model content so AI SDK v6 routes them as images, while preserving `file-data` output for PDFs.

  Existing consumers that inspect raw workspace tool content must handle `image-data` for images; PDFs continue to use `file-data`. Normal tool callers require no change.

- [#2023](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/2023) [`2b2b598`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/2b2b5980e1945cf55f5a11626bc395e7c460516f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Treat `useAgentChat` observer error frames as terminal responses.

  Plain-text error bodies are no longer parsed as stream chunks or merged into an empty assistant message. Error frames now clear observer streaming, replay, recovery, and tool-continuation state even when they omit `done`, matching the transport-owned stream behavior.

  Existing observer UIs that displayed error bodies as assistant messages must move those diagnostics to a dedicated error surface.

- [#1996](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1996) [`753a674`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/753a6748c1d20e56a300bedab6174e43acb33a79) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Update PartyServer and the Cloudflare Workers development toolchain for `@cloudflare/workers-types` v5 compatibility. New Think projects now use Workers Types v5 with matching Wrangler and Vite plugin versions.

- [#2062](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/2062) [`882ae63`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/882ae639fa20973ebdb25458ebc4330ccea8f8b2) Thanks [@ben-reitz](https://github.com/ben-reitz)! - Expose `TurnConfig.repairToolCall` so callers can repair malformed tool calls before tool execution.

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1982](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1982) [`e983026`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e983026b03933a641940d7d048f9fdee5634f875) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Fix AI SDK v7 telemetry, which produced spans with no token counts, no finish reason, no tool results and zero durations.

  Spans that must not outlive their invocation now close at the end of it rather than at the first `await`. Closing at the handoff ended every WebSocket-turn span before its result existed, so every finish-time attribute was dropped. A span still open when its invocation ends is closed and marked `cloudflare.agents.span.truncated` instead of passing as complete, approval spans decided asynchronously included. A chat turn owns its own boundary rather than its caller's, so a turn that is not awaited — an ack-and-return submit, or an auto-continuation fired from a timer — is no longer cut short by the handler that started it. `generateText` is bounded on the same terms as `streamText`, and a turn that fails or is cancelled keeps the usage it already reported.

  `chat` and `execute_tool` spans sit under their `invoke_agent` operation span on v7, where they were previously emitted as unrelated roots, and `tool_approval` segments sit under `execute_tool`.

  v7 has no telemetry metadata bag, so identity and turn context arrive through `runtimeContext` and `telemetry.includeRuntimeContext`. Reserved keys project onto the attributes v6 already emits, so a query written against v6 traces still matches v7 ones; other included keys pass through as `cloudflare.agents.runtime_context.{key}`, and context the caller did not mark stays off the span.

### Minor Changes

- [#1922](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1922) [`cb4c1c7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/cb4c1c722d5a556ce68228d8e60f9c1df604ef81) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Support both AI SDK v6 and v7.

  The `ai` peer range is `ai@^6 || ^7` (and `@ai-sdk/react` is `@^3 || ^4`) across
  `agents`, `@cloudflare/ai-chat`, `@cloudflare/codemode`, and `@cloudflare/think`.
  Consumers can adopt AI SDK v7 or stay on v6 — no forced AI SDK upgrade when
  bumping these packages.

  Only the current implementations are covered. New optimisations and APIs made
  available by AI SDK v7 (broader result-shape audits, stream helper migrations,
  etc.) are intentionally out of scope.

  How dual-version support works — `@cloudflare/think` calls the AI SDK through the
  option names present in both majors (v7 keeps the v6 names as aliases), and
  normalizes the genuine divergences at the boundary:

  - Uses `stepCountIs`, `system`, `experimental_telemetry`, `onStepFinish`, and
    `experimental_onToolCallFinish` (in v7 this alias resolves to
    `onToolExecutionEnd` and fires once).
  - The tool-execution-finished event is normalized across majors: v6's
    `{ success, output, error, durationMs, stepNumber }` and v7's
    `{ toolOutput, toolExecutionMs }` collapse to one `ToolCallResultContext`.
    `stepNumber` is `undefined` under v7 (the v7 event no longer provides it).
  - The UI message stream is built via the result's `toUIMessageStream()` method
    (present in both majors); the standalone `toUIMessageStream({ stream })`
    helper and `result.stream` are v7-only.
  - The workspace read tool emits `{ type: "file-data", data, mediaType, filename }`
    model output, accepted by both majors (v7's newer `{ type: "file", data: {
type: "data", data } }` shape does not exist in v6).

  Public API notes:

  - `@cloudflare/think` keeps `system`, `onStepFinish`, and `experimental_telemetry`
    where callers already use them, and also accepts `TurnConfig.telemetry`
    (forwarded ahead of `experimental_telemetry` when present).
  - `@cloudflare/ai-chat` updates the `AIChatAgent.onChatMessage` callback type
    from `StreamTextOnFinishCallback` to `GenerateTextOnFinishCallback`.

  Verified against both `ai@6` and `ai@7`: `@cloudflare/think` type-checks with
  zero errors and its full workers test suite passes under each major.

  Known limitations:

  - `workers-ai-provider` (Think's default model provider) is fixed at v4 for AI
    SDK v7. Consumers on `ai@6` who rely on Think's built-in default model may hit
    a provider-version mismatch; passing their own `LanguageModel` avoids this.
  - `chat@4.31.0` currently declares an `ai@^6` peer and does not yet advertise
    v7 support; tracked separately.
  - CI should exercise both an `ai@6` and an `ai@7` resolution to guard the matrix.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`cb4c1c7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/cb4c1c722d5a556ce68228d8e60f9c1df604ef81)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#1860](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1860) [`f5b1dd8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f5b1dd814b5d7b415152afda053b5a52e086e12e) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Think agents emit Cloudflare-native traces out of the box with no tracing setup beyond enabling Worker traces. Named lifecycle and storage-phase spans group Durable Object internals around startup, request persistence, turn preparation, inference, result persistence, recovery, alarms, and durable submissions. Every inference call produces an `invoke_agent {agent class}` span with `chat {model}` and `execute_tool {tool}` children. Think supplies durable identity and turn metadata. Payload storage remains off by default; agents can set `storeMessages` for OTel-schema model messages (`{ role, parts }`, canonical tool parts, and output `finish_reason`) on `chat` and `storeTools` for tool arguments/results on `execute_tool`. These flags configure the wrapper and are never emitted as metadata or attributes. Model streams are finalized on early exit, and durable submissions run from their awaited alarm invocation so spans do not outlive invocation boundaries.

### Patch Changes

- [#1860](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1860) [`f5b1dd8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f5b1dd814b5d7b415152afda053b5a52e086e12e) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Group SDK-managed initialization, startup, chat interactions, turns, and durable submissions into semantic phases. Storage-heavy setup, hydration, recovery, request persistence, and response persistence each receive a named bucket, keeping inference and tool spans visible without discarding lower-level Durable Object SQLite spans. Each span records agent identity, storage phase, a stable marker for UI grouping, and operation-specific metadata. No-op on runtimes without the `tracing` API.

- [#1959](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1959) [`a3cbed1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a3cbed1d9944690cf856238f1466940def9a3101) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Cache MCP JSON Schema conversion for the current catalog on each live connection, and let Think agents skip direct MCP AI-tool exposure when those tools are exposed through Code Mode or another mechanism outside Think's automatic tool set.

- [#1963](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1963) [`3ce98ff`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3ce98ff084fcd5f0f8433e1f20352f0a170e3e4a) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Reconcile stale `useAgentChat` server-streaming state after an errored client reconnects.

  Reconnect probes now include correlation IDs, and `STREAM_RESUME_NONE` distinguishes globally idle agents from active continuations owned by another connection. The hook clears fallback streaming state only for a correlated idle response. Reconnect opens are retained while a prior resume or status transition settles, in-flight handshakes are retransmitted on replacement sockets, and all AI SDK resume entry points share one serialization gate.

- [#1937](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1937) [`ed9f42b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/ed9f42b447f244a20801cf2cbcba72a191f73c9d) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Forward routing props through the Think `onStart` lifecycle wrapper.

- [#1860](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1860) [`f5b1dd8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f5b1dd814b5d7b415152afda053b5a52e086e12e) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Run durable submissions only from their awaited scheduled drain, preventing model work and tracing spans from outliving the short submission-acceptance invocation.

- [#1949](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1949) [`32e7390`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/32e73900f4c6bf9cec1b09bb08085fbe46073a99) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Warn when `getSkills()` makes an overridden `getSystemPrompt()` fallback-only and document using Session context blocks for always-on instructions.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1907](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1907) [`38bf87a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/38bf87a3e887de328f22b1f8fe26d53de1c5e72d) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - feat(think): add channelSpeakerLabel option to MessengerDefinition for configurable channel speaker prefixing

  Channel (non-DM) messages and action events are prefixed with the speaker label
  so the model can attribute multi-user traffic; direct messages never get a
  prefix. Previously action events were labelled even in DMs — they now follow the
  same channel-only rule as regular messages.

- [#1921](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1921) [`7e0c069`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7e0c069226f0c953a58de22481fd6cec2608e75b) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Add `ChatOptions.metadata` — a per-turn, recovery-safe metadata carrier.

  Server-side callers of `chat()` / `chatWithMessengerContext()` can now attach immutable per-turn metadata (e.g. "which authenticated principal initiated this turn"). It is stamped onto the turn's user message alongside `channel` (as `metadata.turnMetadata`) so a recovered/continued turn re-resolves it from durable history, and is readable turn-scoped via the new `Think.activeTurnMetadata` getter.

  The trust model mirrors the channel stamp: the reserved metadata keys `channel` and `turnMetadata` are now stripped from client-supplied messages at intake, so a client can never forge server-written turn context (this also closes the prior gap where a client message could carry a forged `metadata.channel`). This lets messenger/RPC entry points carry correct multi-user identity without either mutable agent-wide state (a last-writer-wins race) or the submission path (which loses incremental streaming).

### Patch Changes

- [#1920](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1920) [`0235fc9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/0235fc926f6b8ebdd2f7922dc9c5fa025c0a8c9a) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Rewrite the bot's own unresolved self-mention in messenger events to its readable handle before the model sees it.

  When a user @-mentions a Think messenger bot, the triggering message leads with the bot's own mention. Adapters resolve every other user's mention to `@DisplayName` but leave the bot's own as a raw user-id token (for example, Slack's `@U0BD9EYL52S`), which small models can misread as a third party the sender was trying to reach. Think now rewrites that surviving self-mention to `@<userName>` (the bot handle already required on every messenger) in `defaultChatSdkEvent`, reconstructing the `@handle` the sender originally typed.

  Adds the exported `resolveSelfMention` helper. Rewriting only applies when the adapter exposes a `botUserId`, so handle-based adapters (for example, Telegram) are unaffected. No new configuration is required.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- [`58eea18`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/58eea18f74dec943a5e9df3d78135f8980c445c4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - trigger a release

- [#1839](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1839) [`62b90eb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/62b90eba069285c53b5dd76ff942a2bedbd2dccc) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Preserve attachment `fetchMetadata` through messenger event serialization so sub-agents can re-fetch files.

  When a conversation resolver routes a thread to a sub-agent Durable Object, the messenger event is run through `serializableMessengerEvent()` before crossing the DO boundary. That serialization previously dropped everything except `id`, `mediaType`, `name`, `size`, `text`, and `url` from each attachment — discarding `fetch`, `raw`, and (for adapters that store their platform identifier there) the only remaining handle on the file.

  For adapters like `@chat-adapter/telegram`, the file identifier lives exclusively in `fetchMetadata.fileId` and the top-level `id` is never populated, so photos became irretrievable inside a sub-agent (`attachment.id` and `attachment.fetch` were both missing).

  `MessengerAttachment` now carries a serialization-safe `fetchMetadata?: Record<string, string>` field that survives the sub-agent hop. `toMessengerAttachment()` copies `fetchMetadata` from the underlying Chat SDK attachment and backfills the top-level `id` from a known metadata key (`id`, `fileId`, `mediaId`, `fileUniqueId`) when the adapter doesn't set one. A downstream agent can use `fetchMetadata` together with the adapter's `rehydrateAttachment()` to reconstruct the download closure.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1832](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1832) [`51ec433`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/51ec433b7de191cab3fb73f331261488bae6e8a3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - `getModel()` now accepts a model id string, resolved through a built-in `workers-ai-provider` instance — no separate provider package to install, import, or wire up for the common case.

  Think now depends on `workers-ai-provider` (plus the `@ai-sdk/openai` and `@ai-sdk/anthropic` wire-format plugins) directly. When `getModel()` returns a string, Think resolves it off your `AI` binding:

  - A `@cf/...` id hits Workers AI directly (with `sessionAffinity` wired in automatically for prefix-cache hits).
  - Any other `"<provider>/<model>"` slug — e.g. `"openai/gpt-5.5"`, `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"`, `"google/gemini-2.5-pro"`, `"xai/grok-4"`, `"groq/..."` — is routed through AI Gateway.

  ```typescript
  export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
    getModel() {
      return "@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code"; // or "openai/gpt-5.5"
    }
  }
  ```

  Returning a fully-constructed AI SDK `LanguageModel` from `getModel()` still works unchanged for any other provider or for full control over provider/gateway options. A new `getAIBinding()` override (default `this.env.AI`) controls which binding the string resolver uses.

  Because `getModel()` may now return a bare string, a new public `resolveModel(model?)` method (defaults to resolving `getModel()`) returns a concrete `LanguageModel`. Use it for side inference calls — e.g. summarization/compaction `generateText` — instead of passing `getModel()` straight to the AI SDK.

  The per-turn override `TurnConfig.model` (returned from `beforeTurn`) also accepts a `ThinkModel` now, so you can switch models for a turn with a plain string (e.g. a cheaper model for continuations). The per-step override `StepConfig.model` (returned from `beforeStep`) accepts a `ThinkModel` too — Think resolves a string back into a `LanguageModel` before handing the step to the AI SDK.

  `getModel()` is typed to return `ThinkModel` (a newly exported alias for `LanguageModel | ThinkModelId`). `ThinkModelId` (also exported) gives editor autocomplete for the Workers AI text-generation catalog (`@cf/...`, derived from the installed `@cloudflare/workers-types`) while still accepting any string — gateway catalog slugs like `"openai/gpt-5.5"` are validated at runtime, since the catalog lives server-side and is not knowable from types.

### Patch Changes

- [#1827](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1827) [`e5e6b57`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e5e6b5731e1c316a7edfeac47dfef6a9cadfe3a3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix sub-agent tool events getting stuck at `input-available` when an agent-tool child proxies a remote `toUIMessageStreamResponse()` ([#1589](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1589)).

  `tailAgentToolRun` (in both `AIChatAgent` and `Think`) drained the stored chunk backlog and only afterwards attached its live forwarder, with `await` boundaries in between. Any chunk the child stored and broadcast in that window was neither in the drained snapshot nor live-forwarded, so it silently vanished from the parent's stream — leaving tool parts (notably `tool-output-available`) stuck at `input-available` in `useAgentToolEvents`. A network-paced proxied remote stream hits this window constantly, while a fast local child mostly avoids it. The forwarder is now registered before the backlog is drained, with live chunks buffered and replayed in order and deduped by sequence, closing the gap.

  Both `AIChatAgent` and `Think` also realign the in-memory live sequence to the stored high-water mark after draining. Without this, a re-attach after the child's Durable Object restarts or wakes from hibernation (where the live counter is cold but the durable backlog sits at N) would hand the recovered turn's new chunks sequences from 0, which the high-water dedupe silently drops — leaving the parent permanently stuck with no post-restart chunks.

### Patch Changes

- [#1826](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1826) [`1bbd9bc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/1bbd9bca45834e7699969d83d203ec82f53a9bac) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add a tight, OOM-specific retry budget to chat recovery so a memory-limit crash loop seals fast and attributably ([#1825](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1825)).

  When a recovery turn hits a Durable Object memory-limit reset (the isolate exceeded its 128 MB limit), recovery now classifies it as a distinct, deterministic failure rather than a deploy-style transient. A memory reset re-OOMs on re-run (the turn's working set, not the platform, is the cause), so it must NOT be deferred and retried forever like a code-update/connection-lost transient. Each such crash bumps a durable per-incident `oomAttempts` counter; recovery retries a small number of times (new `chatRecovery.maxOomRetries`, default `3`) — in case the OOM was a transient spike — then seals with `reason="out_of_memory"`. This is far tighter than the generic `maxRecoveryWork` backstop because an OOM is attributable and each re-run re-runs the model.

  This complements the finite `maxRecoveryWork` default: the OOM budget is the fast path for memory resets that surface as catchable errors thrown from recovery bookkeeping (e.g. storage/SQL rejections after the reset), while `maxRecoveryWork` remains a backstop for the hard-kill case where no in-isolate code runs to record the OOM.

  Adds an **alarm-boundary circuit breaker** (`agents`) as the universal backstop for the case the in-DO budgets can't catch ([#1825](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1825)): a memory-limit reset that bypasses them entirely — thrown before the budget code runs (e.g. boot-time state hydration OOMs), or whose own small writes also OOM under memory pressure. Left unhandled, such an error propagates out of `alarm()` and the platform auto-retries the alarm forever, re-running the doomed, billable turn each cycle. `Agent.alarm()` now intercepts ONLY Durable Object memory-limit resets at the outermost frame — where the heavy turn has unwound and GC has reclaimed its footprint, so the seal/purge writes can land where mid-turn ones OOMed. A durable strike counter tolerates a few resets (new `static options.maxAlarmMemoryLimitStrikes`, default `3`) — backing off the looping rows so the retry is not a hot loop — then seals the recovery (`out_of_memory`) and surgically purges only the looping schedule rows, leaving unrelated scheduled tasks intact. A new `alarm:memory_limit_reset` observability event is emitted. Everything except memory-limit resets re-throws exactly as before.

  Also broadens and exports the `isDurableObjectMemoryLimitReset(error)` predicate from `agents` (a sibling to `isDurableObjectCodeUpdateReset` / `isPlatformTransientError`): it now matches the shared `"exceeded its memory limit"` fragment so truncated/reworded surfacings (observed in real [#1825](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1825) logs) still classify.

- [#1826](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1826) [`1bbd9bc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/1bbd9bca45834e7699969d83d203ec82f53a9bac) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix neverending chat-recovery retries when a Durable Object isolate runs out of memory mid-turn ([#1825](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1825)).

  `chatRecovery.maxRecoveryWork` now defaults to a generous finite backstop (`1000`) instead of `Infinity`. An isolate that exceeds its memory limit and is reset mid-stream has usually already streamed a little content, which bumps the durable progress counter. On the next wake recovery reads that as forward progress and **resets both progress-keyed bounds** — the attempt cap (`maxAttempts`) and the no-progress window (`noProgressTimeoutMs`) — and because each crash lands inside the alarm-debounce window the attempt counter is pinned too. With the work budget disabled (`Infinity`), no instrument could ever seal the turn, so recovery re-ran the turn (and its LLM calls) forever. The work meter is the one signal that keeps climbing across such a loop, so a finite default seals a runaway with `reason="work_budget_exceeded"` instead of looping.

  Work only accrues from the first interruption until the turn completes, so a normal interrupted turn never approaches the cap. A very long agentic turn that legitimately produces a large amount of content under heavy interruption can raise `maxRecoveryWork` (or set it to `Infinity` to restore the previous fully-unbounded behavior, ideally paired with a `shouldKeepRecovering` predicate that bounds the runaway via real token/cost accounting).

  `createFetchTools()` generates a generic, allowlisted `fetch_url` tool plus one `fetch_<name>` tool per named service-binding/`Fetcher` target. It is `GET`-only with Workers-grounded SSRF defenses (private/loopback/link-local/`*.internal` blocking, URL normalization, credential rejection), separate download/model/workspace size limits (`maxBytes`, `maxModelChars`, `response: "workspace"` spill), an allowlist-aware redirect policy with cross-origin header stripping, a model header allowlist, and a `tool:fetch` observability event. Disabled by default.

- [#1823](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1823) [`b58b5a3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b58b5a3cb5eba150e12bff2ef6dbfebd1bed6248) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Improve Think's tool-call lifecycle hooks (follow-ups from [#1343](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1343)):

  - **Preserve preliminary streaming through `beforeToolCall`.** Tools whose `execute` is an async generator (`async function* execute(...)`) now stream their preliminary tool-results to the model even though Think wraps `execute` to consult `beforeToolCall` first. Non-streaming tools keep a scalar wrapper, so they never emit a synthetic `preliminary` chunk. The non-canonical `async () => makeIterator()` form (a `Promise<AsyncIterable>`) still collapses to its last yielded value, matching the raw AI SDK.
  - **Per-tool typing on the lifecycle contexts.** When an explicit `TOOLS` generic is passed, narrowing on `ctx.toolName` now narrows `ctx.input` on `beforeToolCall` and — new — `ctx.output` on `afterToolCall`'s success branch to that tool's inferred output type. Dynamic tools stay `unknown`. Behavior with the default `ToolSet` is unchanged.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1758](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1758) [`6b46b04`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6b46b044c03e9fda280c9916fef6ec8b6baa7d73) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add progress signalling and durable milestones for agent-tool sub-agents
  (cloudflare/agents#1758, rfc-detached-agent-tools §progress, phases 4a + 4b).

  A sub-agent running as an agent tool (awaited or detached/background) can now
  report mid-run progress:

  ```ts
  // Inside the child sub-agent (e.g. from a tool's execute):
  await this.reportProgress({
    fraction: 0.6,
    phase: "deploying",
    message: "Generating menu page…"
  });
  ```

  These signals ride the child's own turn stream as a transient
  `data-agent-progress` part, so they re-broadcast to the parent's connected
  clients and surface on `AgentToolRunState.progress` via `useAgentToolEvents` — a
  background-runs tray can render a live bar / phase / status line without drilling
  in. Highlights:

  - **`reportProgress({ fraction?, message?, phase?, data? }, { persist? })`** on
    chat agents (`@cloudflare/think`, `AIChatAgent`); a no-op with a dev warning on
    the base `Agent` and when called outside an active agent-tool run. The framework
    resolves the run id from the active turn — no threading required. Bursts are
    coalesced (latest-wins; a `fraction >= 1` "done" frame always flushes). `data`
    is live-only unless `{ persist: true }`.
  - **`onProgress(run, progress)`** parent hook, fired best-effort from the tail
    for both awaited and detached runs.
  - **Latest-snapshot persistence + recovery inspect.** The child stores a
    `progress_json` + `last_signal_at` on its run row and surfaces it through
    `inspectAgentToolRun().progress`, so a rehydrated parent reconstructs progress
    after eviction.
  - **Resetting no-progress budget for detached runs.** Once a detached child has
    reported at least one signal, the backbone gives up if it then goes silent for
    `detachedNoProgressBudgetMs` (default 1h; per-run override via
    `detached: { noProgressBudgetMs }`), surfaced as `interrupted` with the
    `no-progress` reason. A child that never reports is bounded only by the absolute
    `detachedMaxBudgetMs` ceiling — we never give up on a run merely for being slow.

  ## Durable milestones (phase 4b)

  Naming a `milestone` promotes a signal from the ephemeral tier to a **durable**
  one — there is still only one emit method:

  ```ts
  // Inside the child sub-agent:
  await this.reportProgress({
    milestone: "sources-gathered",
    data: { sources: 2 }
  });
  ```

  - **Persisted + replayable.** Each milestone is one row on the child
    (`cf_agent_tool_milestones` / `cf_ai_chat_agent_tool_milestones`) with a
    monotonic per-run `sequence`. It rides the stream as a **persisted**
    `data-agent-milestone` part (vs. transient progress), so drill-in replay and a
    rehydrated parent both see it. Surfaced via `inspectAgentToolRun().milestones`
    and `AgentToolRunState.milestones` (deduped by `sequence`).
  - **`onProgress` fires for milestones too** — the snapshot carries
    `progress.milestone`, so a consumer can branch on milestone vs. ephemeral.
  - **`detached: { onMilestones }` chat convenience** (`@cloudflare/think` and
    `AIChatAgent`). When a configured milestone lands, the chat agent surfaces an
    idempotent synthetic chat message (keyed/idempotent per `(runId, name)`)
    _before_ the run finishes. Delivered from both the warm tail and the cold
    backbone reconcile; the deterministic id collapses them to at-most-once. Two
    modes (the `string[]` shorthand defaults to `"narrate"`):

    - `"narrate"` (default) — a synthetic **assistant** message injected directly
      (no inference): a cheap, honest status line that does not trigger a turn.
    - `"react"` — a **user-role** turn so the model responds to the milestone
      (steer, start dependent work). Costs a model turn.

    ```ts
    detached: { onMilestones: ["preview-ready"] } // narrate (default)
    detached: { onMilestones: { names: ["needs-approval"], mode: "react" } }
    ```

    Override the wording via `formatDetachedMilestone(run, milestone)`. These
    synthetic messages carry `metadata.source` so clients can render them as an
    agent **event** rather than a human turn (the example does this).

  The awaitable join point (`awaitAgentToolMilestone`, phase 4c) is intentionally
  not included here — it is gated behind a design addendum.

- [#1758](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1758) [`6b46b04`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6b46b044c03e9fda280c9916fef6ec8b6baa7d73) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `detached: { notify: true }` support for `runAgentTool` on chat agents
  (`@cloudflare/think` and `AIChatAgent`) (cloudflare/agents#1752).

  When a detached sub-agent run finishes, a chat agent can inject a message back
  into the chat so the model reacts to the result — without you wiring `onFinish`
  by hand:

  ```ts
  await this.runAgentTool(ResearchAgent, {
    input,
    detached: { notify: { source: "research-background" } }
  });
  ```

  The injected turn is idempotent per run + terminal status, so an exactly-once
  finish never duplicates, while a soft give-up followed by a real late completion
  surfaces as two distinct turns. (Think dedupes via a `submitMessages`
  idempotency key; `AIChatAgent`, which has no durable-submission layer, persists
  under a deterministic message id and runs the follow-up turn inline within the
  already-serialized delivery slot.) Use `notify: true` for the default
  `metadata.source`, pass `notify: { source }` to match your app's message
  taxonomy, and override `formatDetachedCompletion(run, result)` to customize (or
  suppress) the injected text.

- [#1817](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1817) [`7f367d8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7f367d88eb988d5f0285d4922d1091c7f69361a3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - `create-think` now prompts for a starter template when `--template` is omitted (and falls back to `basic` when stdin is non-interactive). `npm create think` and `think init` initialize a git repository — skipping cleanly when the target is already inside one — and scaffold projects with Oxlint/Oxfmt config plus a `check` script. Removes the unused declarative `agent()` framework helper and the identity helpers (`defineMessengers`, `defineScheduledTasks`, `defineChannels`) in favor of class-based agents and typed object returns.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `ctx.attachReply(attachment)` for actions: an advisory, recording-only reply-attachment side-channel surfaced on `ChatResponseResult.attachments` (in `onChatResponse`) and a public `replyAttachments(requestId?)` getter. Attachments are JSON-normalized, deep-copied on read, capped per turn, and never alter the model-visible tool output; policy callbacks are no-ops, failed executions discard their attachments, approval-gated approved actions support it, and durable-pause approved actions are a v1 no-op.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add a pending-retry lease for the action ledger via the new `actionLedgerPendingRetryLeaseMs` config (default 5 minutes). A `pending` ledger row left behind by a crashed executor is now reclaimed and re-run once it is stale, but ONLY for actions that declare an explicit `idempotencyKey` — the key is the developer's assertion that re-running the keyed side effect is safe. Behavior change: such a stale row previously blocked forever with `ActionPendingError`; it now reclaims (refreshing `updated_at` in place, still `pending`), emits `action:ledger:reclaimed`, and re-runs `execute`. Fresh rows, fallback `tool:${toolCallId}` keys, and a disabled lease (`actionLedgerPendingRetryLeaseMs = false`) keep the conservative `ActionPendingError` behavior. Same-isolate coalescing still wins first, so an in-flight run is never reclaimed.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add a durable action ledger for `action()` descriptors so settled server action outputs can be replayed by stable idempotency key without re-running side effects.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Generalize the messenger runtime into a public channel surface. Add `configureChannels()` and `ChannelDefinition` (web, voice, messenger, and custom channels) wrapping `getMessengers()`, a no-turn `deliverNotice()` with `informModel`, additive `DeliveryTag` (kind + turnEnded) on messenger snapshots, per-channel policy (instructions, tool-narrowing, `maxTurns`) applied as overridable defaults, turn-scoped channel context threaded through `runTurn` (persisted for recovery), reply-attachment rendering at delivery, and `channel:*`/`notice:*` observability events.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add durable-pause approval descriptors: `durable-pause` actions now park in a dedicated `cf_think_action_pending_approvals` store and resume via `approveExecution`/`rejectExecution` with a connection-independent continuation, so a turn can be approved from a dashboard with no live socket (this also fixes codemode `approveExecution` from a dashboard). A unified `ActionApprovalDescriptor` is attached to durable-pause, codemode, and approval-gated parts, `pendingApprovals()` lists all pending approvals for cold-load reconciliation, and an overridable `describePausedExecution()` hook enriches codemode descriptors.

- [#1801](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1801) [`c58b401`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c58b4015b7616581b3d7fca86a5fde6e49bd9cd3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `@cloudflare/think/react`, a Think-tuned `useAgentChat` wrapper that keeps `setMessages` local-only by default while reusing the shared chat React implementation.

- [#1788](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1788) [`3b2af54`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3b2af5444af5002cd54fd493452e03c721d31999) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - `Think` now annotates and logs row-size compaction the same way
  `@cloudflare/ai-chat` does.

  When a persisted message exceeds the SQLite row-size limit and `Think` compacts
  its tool outputs or truncates its text parts to fit, the resulting message now
  carries `metadata.compactedToolOutputs` (the compacted tool-call IDs) and/or
  `metadata.compactedTextParts` (the truncated text-part indices), and `Think`
  emits a `console.warn` describing the compaction. The compaction itself is
  unchanged — `Think` already used the shared shape-preserving `truncateToolOutput`
  compactor — this only adds the previously ai-chat-only annotations/warnings so a
  client can tell that a stored message was compacted. Both packages now share one
  `enforceRowSizeLimit` implementation.

- [#1790](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1790) [`190ea81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/190ea814c4ea61c216509a431baa8be06d917256) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add public `runTurn(options)` facade (Turns RFC step 2): unified turn admission
  with `mode: "wait" | "submit" | "stream"` delegating to the existing
  `saveMessages`, `continueLastTurn`, `submitMessages`, and `chat` methods.
  Exports `TurnInputMessages`, `RunTurnWait`, `RunTurnSubmit`, `RunTurnStream`,
  `RunTurnOptions`, and `TurnResult`.

- [#1799](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1799) [`3c2afc9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3c2afc9379f34fe51e401999ec03e9efc0fe93f2) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Allow `runTurn({ mode: "stream" })` to accept array and function inputs, matching the existing `wait` mode input surface while preserving the durable `submit` function-input guard.

### Patch Changes

- [#1788](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1788) [`3b2af54`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3b2af5444af5002cd54fd493452e03c721d31999) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Converge recovery forward-progress crediting between `AIChatAgent` and `Think`.

  Both hosts now credit the recovery no-progress counter through one shared, host-agnostic rule (`shouldCreditStreamProgress`): a progress milestone (a started text/reasoning segment or a settled tool input/output) credits unconditionally, and mid-segment streaming deltas (`text-delta`/`reasoning-delta`/`tool-input-delta`) credit at most once per throttle window via a per-isolate `StreamProgressCreditThrottle`. Previously `AIChatAgent` credited only on chunk-type milestones while `Think` credited on its flush cadence, so a long single content segment spanning repeated crashes could read as "no progress" under `AIChatAgent` and false-fire its `no_progress_timeout`. The new rule is never coarser than either host's prior cadence, so it can only delay or avoid a false no-progress timeout, never hasten give-up.

- [#1803](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1803) [`c476265`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c476265c9f18a2a6eb5f01137515a8776ca8b63c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix AI SDK `status` getting stuck after a reconnect that races a turn's
  pre-stream window ([#1784](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1784)).

  A turn is "accepted but pre-stream" while it is queued, debouncing, or awaiting
  async setup before its resumable stream starts. A client that connected or sent
  a `STREAM_RESUME_REQUEST` in that window was answered with `STREAM_RESUME_NONE`
  ("nothing to resume"), so its short resume probe resolved `null` and AI SDK
  `status` settled on `ready` even though the server went on to stream — leaving
  the UI unable to render the in-flight turn until a full remount.

  This adds a shared `PreStreamTurns` tracker (`agents/chat`) and a new
  server→client `cf_agent_stream_pending` frame:

  - The resume handshake now parks resume requests that arrive during the
    pre-stream window and emits `STREAM_PENDING` ("keep waiting") instead of
    `STREAM_RESUME_NONE`, then flushes parked connections into the normal
    `STREAM_RESUMING` handshake once the stream actually starts (and releases them
    with `STREAM_RESUME_NONE` if the turn is superseded/cleared before streaming).
  - On `STREAM_PENDING` the client transport extends its resume probe from the
    5s fast-path to a 60s backstop so the probe stays open across the gap.
  - `useAgentChat` re-probes the stream on a transparent socket reopen (e.g. a
    1006 reconnect that does not remount the component) so `status` recovers.
  - Continuation affinity is relaxed via an optional `isConnectionPresent` host
    hook so a transparent reconnect (whose connection id changed) can resume a
    continuation whose original owner connection is gone.

  Wired into both `AIChatAgent` and `@cloudflare/think`.

  The pre-stream tracker is in-memory only; it is hibernation-safe because a turn
  in its pre-stream window is an unresolved message-handler promise that pins the
  Durable Object in memory, so eviction only happens once a stream is durably
  recorded (and resumes via `ResumableStream`) or the turn has finished. Skipped
  turns (supersede/generation change) settle without releasing parked
  connections, so a client parked during the window survives onto the successor
  turn instead of being cut loose by a premature `STREAM_RESUME_NONE`.

- [#1788](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1788) [`3b2af54`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3b2af5444af5002cd54fd493452e03c721d31999) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Recovery give-up now resolves the orphaned stream by newest metadata row.

  The stable-timeout/error give-up path that terminalizes an exhausted recovery
  turn previously resolved the turn's orphaned stream id with an in-memory
  first-match scan over all stream metadata, while the wake (restart) path already
  used the newest durable row keyed by the recovery-root request id. These two
  lookups are now a single seam, so both paths surface the same partial — the
  newest stream the turn produced — when a request id spans more than one
  recovery attempt. Single-attempt turns (one stream row per request id) are
  unaffected.

- [#1794](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1794) [`b6ad4d5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b6ad4d5bc078ede978b9b68fd7beb6ed3194f848) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Extract transcript repair into a shared `agents/chat` primitive.

  `@cloudflare/think`'s `_repairToolTranscriptParts` — which flips an interrupted
  tool call (a `tool-*` / `dynamic-tool` part with no settled result, left behind
  when a stream was cut off mid-flight) into an errored tool-result so the next
  provider call doesn't 400 with `AI_MissingToolResultsError`, and normalizes
  malformed tool `input` — now lives once as the shared, `@internal`
  `repairInterruptedToolParts` primitive (plus the `toolPartHasSettledResult`
  terminal-state check) in `agents/chat`.

  The primitive is pure (returns a new messages array plus repair stats; never
  touches storage, broadcast, or events) and is parameterized by an overridable
  `repairPart` hook plus an optional `shouldRepair(part)` skip predicate (defaults
  to repairing every interrupted part), so both AI-SDK chat hosts can run repair
  logic before re-entering inference on a recovered turn — a host whose default
  errors the part (ai-chat) uses `shouldRepair` to leave a part still awaiting a
  client interaction verbatim. `@cloudflare/think` delegates through its existing
  `repairInterruptedToolPart` hook with no `shouldRepair` (repairs everything) — a
  pure internal refactor with no observable behavior or API change; its suites pass
  unchanged.

  abandoned as `interrupted` after a deploy.

  When a facet running as an agent-tool child was interrupted mid-run (e.g. a
  deploy evicted it), its recovery continuation (`continueLastTurn` /
  `_retryLastUserTurn`) minted a fresh request id but left
  `cf_agent_tool_child_runs.request_id` pointing at the pre-eviction turn. Frame
  attribution (`_agentToolRunForRequest`) then failed, so the recovered turn's
  broadcast frames never reached the parent's re-attach tail; the parent saw no
  forward progress and sealed a still-advancing child `interrupted` once its
  no-progress budget elapsed. The recovery paths now re-bind the child-run row
  (and the in-memory attribution map) to the current turn's request id, keeping
  frames flowing across recovery so the parent re-attaches and follows the child
  to its real terminal.

  `continueLastTurn` already re-resolved the channel from the persisted user
  message (`metadata.channel`) so a recovered partial turn re-applied its
  channel's instructions / tool narrowing. The pre-stream retry path
  (`_retryLastUserTurn`, used by `_chatRecoveryRetry`) admitted the recovered turn
  without re-resolving the channel, so an interrupted-before-streaming turn was
  retried with the default policy instead of the channel's — even though the
  `metadata.channel` stamp survived. It now re-resolves and re-applies the channel
  on both recovery paths, matching the documented invariant.

  before reporting stable, converging onto `@cloudflare/ai-chat`.

  Previously, when a turn ended with no pending human/client interaction,
  `waitUntilStable()` reported stable immediately — even if an auto-continuation
  was armed (its ~50ms coalesce timer still pending, or its completeness drain in
  flight). In that window idle eviction or chat recovery could act on a transcript
  that was about to be continued. `Think` now mirrors `@cloudflare/ai-chat`: while
  a continuation is armed (`pending && !pastCoalesce` and the shared
  `AutoContinuationController` reports armed), `waitUntilStable()` reports
  not-stable and waits out the coalesce window, then re-checks (the continuation
  either fires and enqueues a turn the loop drains, or parks and clears, at which
  point the agent is genuinely stable).

  `think studio [agent] [instance]` launches Think Studio — a bundled local web app that connects (over WebSocket) to any running Think instance, local dev server or deployed Worker. Studio provides streaming chat (with tool calls and inline approve/reject for `needsApproval` tools) plus a read-only inspector showing the agent's identity, connection status, live state, recent history, and a turn/recovery status badge. The CLI serves the prebuilt SPA from a tiny `node:http` static server and opens the browser (`--port`, `--no-open`); the browser talks to the agent directly. `think state <agent> [instance]` prints the agent's identity, live state, and a recent history snapshot (`--json`, `--limit`).

  Both commands share connection flags (`--url`, `--host`, `--protocol`, `--token`, `--query`, `--route-prefix`, `--root`), resolve friendly agent ids from the local manifest, and send the token as a query parameter (WebSocket upgrades can't set headers). Chatting in Studio drives a real, persisted turn against the live Durable Object.

  The Think Vite plugin also registers an `s` dev-server shortcut (alongside Vite's built-in `r`/`u`/`o`/`c`/`q`) that launches Studio against the running `pnpm dev` server. Disable it with `studioShortcut: false`.

  `addMessages(messages, options?)` appends (or upserts, via `{ mode: "upsert" }`) into the Session tree without running inference or entering the turn queue, so it is safe to call from inside a tool `execute`. Array entries are appended linearly into one path; appends are idempotent by message id; `parentId` controls the attach point (latest committed leaf by default, `null` for root, and an unknown id fails fast). This is distinct from `saveMessages()` (which runs a turn) and from `AIChatAgent`'s `persistMessages()` (which replaces/reconciles a flat array). Fixes the Think docs that previously pointed to a nonexistent `persistMessages()` on Think.

  Think now avoids automatic media-eviction scans until hydration has been windowed or an oversized appended message has been observed. The shared resumable stream buffer also avoids per-wake metadata-column introspection by creating new tables with the current columns and lazily migrating legacy tables only when a stream write needs it.

  browsing that needs only the `browser` binding — no Durable Object, loader, or
  sandbox. New primitives in `agents/browser` (`browserMarkdown`,
  `browserExtract`, `browserLinks`, `browserScrape`, `browserContent`,
  `browserSnapshot`, `browserScreenshot`, `browserPdf`, plus `runQuickAction`)
  wrap the `quickAction()` binding and unwrap its `{ success, result }` envelope.
  A new `createQuickActionTools({ browser })` (from `agents/browser/ai`) returns
  AI SDK tools (`browser_markdown`, `browser_extract`, `browser_links`,
  `browser_scrape`, opt-in `browser_content`) so an agent can read a page as
  Markdown, extract structured data with AI, or list/scrape elements in a single
  call. Every result is bounded to `maxChars` (text truncated, oversized
  arrays/objects summarized) to protect the context window, and host-only request
  options (`cookies`, `authenticate`, `gotoOptions`, `viewport`, …) can be passed
  once via `options` for authenticated or JavaScript-heavy pages without exposing
  them to the model. `createBrowserTools`/`createBrowserRuntime` now expose these tools alongside the
  durable `browser_execute` tool **by default** whenever a `browser` binding is
  present (pass `quickActions: false` to opt out), and they resolve `ctx` from the
  current Agent via `getCurrentAgent()` so `ctx` no longer has to be passed
  explicitly from inside an Agent. Result bounding is shape-stable — arrays stay
  arrays (trimmed), so the model sees a consistent type, except when even the
  first element overflows the budget, where the result degrades to the
  truncated-preview summary rather than a misleading empty array.
  `runQuickAction`'s `params` are now typed per action. `@cloudflare/think/tools/browser` re-exports
  `createQuickActionTools` and the Quick Action primitives/types so a Think agent
  can expose them from `getTools()` with a single import. Quick Actions require a
  Worker `compatibility_date` of `2026-03-24`+ and `remote: true` on the browser
  binding for local `wrangler dev`.

Providers that emit no `start.messageId` (e.g. Workers AI) previously left the client to generate its own id, so the live stream and the persisted message broadcast couldn't reconcile by id and the originating tab briefly rendered the turn twice before collapsing. The `start` chunk is now stamped with the allocated assistant id for new turns (continuations are unaffected). Mirrors the same fix in `@cloudflare/ai-chat`.

  config (`createThinkWorkerConfig`) from `2026-01-28` to `2026-06-11`. Apps that
  set `compatibility_date` in their own `wrangler.jsonc` are unaffected; this only
  changes the fallback used when none is specified.

### Minor Changes

- [#1656](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1656) [`4c2d1a7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c2d1a7f7f337bf426b0b35e3c9e8e4901c6360b) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Rebuild the Think execute tool on the codemode connector runtime, with built-in human-in-the-loop approvals.

  **Unified execute tool.** `createExecuteTool` now builds on `createCodemodeRuntime` with connectors instead of a bare executor: `state.*` (the agent's workspace filesystem via `@cloudflare/shell`'s `StateConnector`), `cdp.*` (browser automation via `agents/browser`'s `BrowserConnector`, included automatically when `env.BROWSER` is bound), and `tools.*` (any AI SDK `ToolSet` adapted via `@cloudflare/codemode`'s `ToolSetConnector`). Executions are durable — recorded on a `CodemodeRuntime` facet with abort-and-replay — and completed results are truncated for the model while the full value stays on the execution record.

  - **Agent one-liner** — `createExecuteTool(this)` infers `ctx`, `env.LOADER`, `env.BROWSER`, and the workspace-backed state backend from the Think agent, and accepts an overrides object for custom tools and options. `createExecuteRuntime(this)` returns the underlying `{ runtime, connectors, tool }` for host-side wiring. The runtime handle is exposed on the agent as `this.codemode`.
  - **Human-in-the-loop.** Tools with `needsApproval: true` pause the execution durably. The paused tool output (with bounded pending-call args) flows to the model, which reports and waits. Think gains built-in callables — `pendingExecutions()`, `approveExecution(executionId)`, `rejectExecution(executionId, reason?)` — that resolve the pause on the codemode runtime, replace the paused output in the transcript via `pausedExecutionUpdate`, and auto-continue the conversation so the model sees the outcome. Approval UIs must render args from `pendingExecutions()` (authoritative, full) rather than the transcript's `pending` (a truncated preview bounded for model context). Approvals survive Durable Object restarts and are safe against double-approval, expiry (`expirePaused`), and stale UIs. If the paused tool part is no longer in the transcript when the approval lands (e.g. compacted away), the outcome is appended as a system note instead of being dropped.
  - The Think framework's generated worker entry exports the `CodemodeRuntime` facet class automatically (also re-exported from `@cloudflare/think/server-entry`).
  - Think's `createBrowserTools` follows the rebuilt `agents/browser` connector model (single durable `browser_execute` tool, session modes, stable attach handles) — see the `agents` changeset.
  - **Model-facing guidance.** `createExecuteTool` now renders per-namespace usage hints in the execute tool description (`state.*` object-argument filesystem calls, the actual `tools.*` method names, `cdp.*`), so models stop inventing a `host.*`/`fs.*` API. The `load_extension` description clarifies that its `host` bridge exists only inside extension source. The workspace `bash` tool description now states the workspace is mounted at `/` (no `/workspace`), and the bash sandbox no longer persists its synthetic `/bin`, `/usr`, `/dev`, `/proc` paths into the workspace (previously the first bash call wrote ~160 shell-builtin stubs into the user's workspace and flooded `changedFiles`).

### Patch Changes

- [#1740](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1740) [`6c9de59`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6c9de59a08ba151d62e7eb50a1f3d36eac2eafc4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Defer one-shot scheduled callbacks (and chat-recovery give-ups) on platform transients instead of consuming them mid-deploy ([#1730](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1730)).

  A mid-execution Durable Object code-update reset surfaces storage failures in two shapes: the verbatim reset/supersede messages (already deferred) and `SqlError: SQL query failed: Network connection lost.` — a wrapper that drops the CF `retryable` flag and dodges the reset matcher. The second shape burned the in-process retry budget inside the same few-seconds reset window (which outlasts the retry schedule by design) and then consumed the one-shot row on exhaustion, freezing the turn for minutes until incident re-detection — in the reported production capture, storage was healthy again 15 ms after the final attempt.

  - **`agents`** — new cause-aware `isPlatformTransientError` classifier (exported, alongside `isDurableObjectCodeUpdateReset`): reset/supersede messages, `retryable`-flagged platform errors (excluding overloaded), and "Network connection lost.", looked up through wrapper `cause` chains. `_executeScheduleCallback` keeps in-process retries for connection-lost transients (a genuine blip heals fast) but on exhaustion of a one-shot row it now re-throws instead of swallowing, so the row survives and the alarm re-runs it in the healthy window that follows. Genuine application errors are still abandoned after `maxAttempts` exactly as before.
  - **`@cloudflare/think`** — `_handleRecoveryCallbackError` now defers (re-throws) on any platform transient instead of terminalizing through a give-up whose own seal needs the storage that is down; the bookkeeping write on the defer path is best-effort. The defer path no longer marks the recovered submission `error` (which made the deferred re-run skip with `submission_not_running` — a self-defeating defer); it stays `running` for the re-run to pick up. The give-up now seals the incident `exhausted` only after the terminal writes succeed, so a transient mid-seal defers the whole give-up for an idempotent re-run instead of half-sealing.
  - **`@cloudflare/ai-chat`** — same give-up seal ordering: the incident is sealed only after `_exhaustChatRecovery` (incl. the durable terminal record) succeeds, so a transient mid-seal preserves the one-shot row and the give-up re-runs in full on a healthy isolate.

- [#1737](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1737) [`bc43133`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/bc43133824f87da86e6d62a15ee2f183ed1a3f84) Thanks [@cjol](https://github.com/cjol)! - Fix the two remaining [#1575](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1575) gaps in how in-band stream errors (`{type: "error", errorText}` chunks inside an otherwise-healthy provider stream) are observed after the fact.

  **Errored-stream replay (partial content was lost on reconnect).** A client reconnecting after an in-band error received the terminal error frame ([#1645](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1645)) but not the content the model streamed before the error — the replay path only served `status = 'completed'` streams, so an errored stream's buffered chunks were unreachable, and the server pushes no messages on connect. `ResumableStream` gains `replayErroredChunksByRequestId`, and the resume-ACK terminal replay (`_replayTerminalOnAck` in both AIChatAgent and Think) now replays the errored stream's stored chunks before the `done: true, error: true` frame, so a reconnecting client observes the same sequence a live client did. No wire-format or schema changes: replayed chunks reuse the existing `replay: true` frame shape and the error text still comes from the durable terminal record.

  **Agent-tool error attribution (cross-run contamination).** When an in-band error frame was broadcast on a child agent and the active run was unknown, the error was stamped onto every tailed run — so an unrelated turn's failure (or one of several overlapping runs) could mark healthy runs as `error`, and capture depended on a tailer being attached at the right moment. Frames are now attributed by the request id they carry: each agent-tool run is bound to its turn's request id when the turn starts (persisted on the run row at start rather than at terminal, so attribution survives a DO restart mid-run), and only the owning run's error/progress state is updated. Frame inspection also no longer requires an attached tailer, so error capture is independent of tailer timing.

- [#1712](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1712) [`835e7b0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/835e7b0e0b7bb06c57b35ca3b330e4e962ccffed) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Reclaim resumable-stream buffers from an alarm so idle chats don't leak storage ([#1706](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1706))

  Resumable-stream chunk buffers (`cf_ai_chat_stream_*`) were only swept lazily when a _subsequent_ stream completed. A chat that received a single turn and then went idle never triggered that sweep, so its buffers lingered in the Durable Object's SQLite for the lifetime of the DO.

  `AIChatAgent` and `Think` now arm a scheduled cleanup alarm whenever a stream starts and whenever it finishes (completes or errors). Arming on start guarantees that a stream whose DO is evicted mid-flight and never reaches a finish still gets a future sweep instead of leaking. This is the safety net for the non-durable path (e.g. `chatRecovery: false`, the `AIChatAgent` default): those turns don't run inside `runFiber`, so there's no leftover `keepAlive` alarm and no fiber-recovery scan, and if the client never reconnects nothing else wakes the DO. (Durable `runFiber` turns already self-heal — the `keepAlive` alarm survives eviction, wakes the DO, and recovery finalizes the stream, which arms cleanup — so arming on start is belt-and-suspenders there.) The alarm sweeps aged buffers via the retention windows below and re-arms only while reclaimable rows remain, so a fully-swept DO stops waking itself. Arming is idempotent so high-turn-count chats never accumulate cleanup schedules; the in-callback re-arm uses a fresh (non-idempotent) row so it survives the one-shot deletion of the firing schedule. No per-turn Durable Object and no change to the session DO lifecycle are required.

  Retention is now split into two short, purpose-specific windows instead of a single 24h threshold: completed/errored buffers are kept for a brief **10-minute** reconnect-and-replay grace (the assistant message is persisted separately, so the buffer is only needed to replay a just-finished stream or deliver a terminal error frame to a reconnecting client), while abandoned in-flight (`streaming`) rows are kept for **1 hour** so an interrupted turn has ample time to be resumed or recovered before its buffer is presumed dead. The abandoned-row sweep keys off **last chunk activity** rather than stream start time, so a long-running stream that is still emitting chunks is never reclaimed mid-flight.

  `ResumableStream` gains `cleanup(now?)` (force a sweep, bypassing the lazy interval gate) and `hasReclaimableStreams()` to support alarm-driven cleanup.

- [#1713](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1713) [`18c438b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/18c438b05fbc95787b40b6d1c849e569aa253bb9) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Support client tools on the Think sub-agent `chat()` RPC path ([#1709](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1709))

  `ChatOptions` now accepts `clientTools` (the same `ClientToolSchema[]` carried over the WebSocket chat protocol) and an `onClientToolCall` executor. This lets a parent agent that drives a Think sub-agent over `chat()` expose client-defined tools to the sub-agent and complete the tool round trip within the same turn:

  ```ts
  await child.chat(message, callback, {
    signal,
    clientTools: [
      { name: "get_user_timezone", parameters: { type: "object" } }
    ],
    onClientToolCall: async ({ toolName, input }) =>
      runClientTool(toolName, input)
  });
  ```

  Without `onClientToolCall`, the schemas are still registered and the model's call is surfaced through the stream callback (execute-less), matching the WebSocket behavior. With it, the call is resolved inline so the turn can continue to completion — the RPC stream callback has no inbound result channel of its own.

  Unlike the WebSocket path, the schemas and executor are kept per-turn and are NOT persisted: the executor is a live RPC reference that cannot survive an eviction, and there is no SPA to replay a `tool-result`. This keeps chat recovery correct — an eviction-interrupted client-tool call is repaired like a server tool (the model proceeds) rather than being mistaken for a pending human interaction and parking forever.

  `agents/chat`'s `createToolsFromClientSchemas` gains an optional `{ execute }` delegate (and exports a new `ClientToolExecutor` type) to build the executable variant. Both additions are backward-compatible.

- [#1724](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1724) [`c18a446`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c18a446daa4547b886bf01ecd9719a23bf7905fc) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Stop oversized sessions from permanently bricking the Durable Object with `SQLITE_NOMEM` on wake ([#1710](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1710)).

  A throw out of `onStart` is terminal: partyserver resets its init state and rethrows, so every wake — including platform alarm retries — re-runs the failing `onStart` forever, and the failure survives redeploys because it is driven by stored data. Long-lived media-heavy sessions hit exactly this once eager full-transcript hydration approached the isolate's memory budget. Four changes:

  - **`onStart` degrades instead of throwing.** Transcript hydration, declared scheduled-task reconciliation, and durable submission/workflow recovery are now best-effort: failures are recorded (readable via the new public `getOnStartDegradations()`), logged with remediation hints, and emitted as `chat:onstart:degraded` observability events, and the agent comes up reachable. The user-defined `onStart()` is intentionally NOT guarded.
  - **`hydrationByteBudget` (default 24MB).** Cache refreshes hydrate at most this many stored bytes; an oversized transcript boots as a bounded window of the most recent messages — never fewer than the read-time truncation span the model sees at full fidelity (4 messages), so windowing cannot starve the model's context — and emits `chat:hydration:windowed` (on change, not on every sync). Durable storage is never truncated by this; `session.getHistory()` still reads the full path. Set to `Infinity` to restore unbounded hydration.
  - **`mediaEviction` (default on).** Background passes rewrite oversized inline media — large `data:` URL file parts and large strings nested in tool outputs — in messages that have aged out of the recent window, replacing them with size/path markers. By default the original bytes are preserved as workspace files under `/attachments/evicted/` (written BEFORE the row is rewritten, so no pass can lose data); set `externalizeToWorkspace: false` to drop them or `false` to disable. Passes are memory-bounded: row sizes come from `getHistoryRowStats()`, only rows large enough to contain an evictable value are parsed, one at a time, and rewrites use the session's silent maintenance path so no per-row full-history token estimate runs. When a pass stops at `maxRowsPerPass` with a backlog, the next pass is scheduled automatically. Providers without row-stats support log a one-time warning instead of silently no-opping.
  - Plain `text` parts are never evicted, and `keepRecentMessages` is clamped to at least the read-time truncation window (4) so eviction can never rewrite content the model still sees at full fidelity.

The transform(s) returned from `beforeTurn` are now forwarded to `streamText` in the inference loop, so callers can inspect or rewrite the stream — for example, detecting tool results that carry `{ content, sources }` and enqueuing additional `source` parts via the transform's controller. Accepts a single transform or an array applied in order. Closes [#1714](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1714).

  `alarm()` called `_startWorkflowNotificationDrain()` unconditionally, which wrapped its work in `keepAliveWhile(...)`. Acquiring the keepAlive lease armed the 30s keepAlive heartbeat alarm even though there was nothing to drain, and releasing the lease did not pull the alarm back — so the DO re-scheduled itself every 30s and never hibernated.

  `_startWorkflowNotificationDrain()` now returns early when there are no pending notifications, matching its other call sites. Affected DOs self-heal on their next alarm fire after upgrading: `super.alarm()` reschedules to the next legitimate task (or clears the alarm entirely) and the drain no longer re-arms the heartbeat.

  `create-think` is now fully standalone — it owns the starter-template scaffolding logic and depends only on `tiged` + `yargs`, so `npm create think` no longer installs the entire framework just to copy a template.

  `think init` now has two modes:

  - **New project** — when `--template` is given, or when run outside an existing npm project, it delegates to `create-think` to fetch a complete starter template.
  - **Augment in place** — when run inside an existing npm project with no `--template`, it adds Think framework files (agent, Vite/Wrangler config, generated types) and merges dependencies into the current project.

  The internal `@cloudflare/think/cli` export has been removed (its scaffolding logic now lives in `create-think`).

  This release adds a manifest-driven Vite plugin that discovers agents from the
  `agents/` directory, generates a Worker entrypoint and virtual framework
  modules, derives stable Durable Object class names, and merges framework-owned
  Worker config defaults with user Wrangler config. It also keeps the Think Vite
  plugin usable directly in normal Vite plugin arrays.

  The framework now supports optional app server entries, manifest-scoped friendly
  agent and sub-agent routing, deterministic route surfaces, colocated skill
  detection, Worker Loader requirement diagnostics, and explicit diagnostics for
  unsupported nested sub-agent conventions. Think currently supports top-level
  agents and one sub-agent layer; deeper nesting is rejected with guidance so that
  the routing and lifecycle model can be designed deliberately.

  This framework layer is experimental: both the Vite plugin (once, on build
  start) and the `think` CLI (on startup) emit a notice that the API may change
  or be removed in any release. The core Think agent runtime is unchanged.

  The Think CLI now includes `think init`, `think inspect`, and `think types`.
  `think init` scaffolds a minimal Workers/Vite Think app, safely handles prompted
  or named target directories, refuses unsafe migrations, and installs npm
  dependencies by default. `think inspect` exposes manifest/config diagnostics in
  text or JSON, while `think types` generates Think-owned declarations and can
  optionally compose with Wrangler type generation.

  This release also adds host-framework coverage for React Router and TanStack
  Start, updates examples to use the convention-first framework shape, and hardens
  Agents/worker-bundler virtual modules for bundled skill compatibility.

  When a durable chat turn exhausted recovery (e.g. during a deploy/reconnect storm) while no client was connected, the terminal error was only broadcast transiently, so a client that connected afterward never learned the turn failed and the conversation appeared frozen. The outcome is now persisted durably and replayed over the resume handshake on the next reconnect — `STREAM_RESUMING` → `STREAM_RESUME_ACK` → terminal error frame on the resumed stream — which is the only path that surfaces as `useAgentChat`'s `error` on the real client. (A bare replayed frame is dropped by the client because it never reaches a transport stream reader.) The record is cleared once a later turn supersedes it — on a new client request, and also when any later turn ends in a non-error outcome (completed or aborted, including turns driven server-side via `saveMessages`), so a stale exhaustion can never replay after the conversation has recovered. Terminal non-exhaustion errors (e.g. a provider 500) are now durably recorded too, not just transiently broadcast, so they also replay to a reconnecting client.

  `@cloudflare/think` previously recorded the outcome durably but only replayed it as a bare on-connect frame (dropped by the client); it now uses the same resume-handshake delivery.

  Structured workflow prompts previously requested output via the AI SDK `Output.object` path, which streams a JSON Schema `response_format` — rejected by some providers (notably Workers AI). `step.prompt()` now runs a full agentic turn that returns its structured result by calling an internal `think_final_answer` tool whose arguments match the schema. This uses ordinary tool calling, so it works across every provider Think supports (verified on Workers AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic), keeps Think's streaming engine (persistence, recovery, resumable streams), and lets the agent use its own tools across multiple steps before producing the final structured answer.

  The `think_final_answer` tool name is reserved; its call and result are stripped from the persisted conversation so the transcript and later turns do not see Think's internal plumbing.

  - `agents`: `ResumableStream` now **packs** each buffered group of stream chunks into a single SQLite row (a JSON array of chunk bodies) instead of writing one row per chunk. Single-chunk and large-chunk segments are stored unwrapped, and a per-segment byte cap keeps rows within the 2 MB SQLite row limit. This cuts chunk rows written / stored / scanned-on-replay by up to ~10×. Reads (replay, orphan reconstruction, `getStreamChunks`) transparently unpack both packed segments and legacy per-chunk rows, so existing stored data keeps working. Adds shared `buildInClauseStrings` and `MAX_BOUND_PARAMS` helpers exported from `agents/chat`.
  - `@cloudflare/ai-chat`: message cleanup (stale-row pruning and `maxPersistedMessages` enforcement) previously issued one `DELETE` per row in a loop; it now deletes rows in batched `DELETE ... WHERE id IN (...)` queries (capped at 100 bound parameters per query).
  - `@cloudflare/think`: `deleteSubmissions()` cleanup previously issued one `DELETE` per terminal submission (up to 500 per call); it now deletes rows in batched `DELETE ... WHERE submission_id IN (...)` queries.
  - `@cloudflare/ai-chat` & `@cloudflare/think`: chat-recovery incident TTL sweep previously deleted each stale incident with a separate awaited `storage.delete(key)` (which also defeats Durable Object write-coalescing); it now deletes incidents in batched `storage.delete(keys)` calls (up to 128 keys per call).

### Patch Changes

- [#1684](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1684) [`ab6dd95`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/ab6dd95b791a60fe5a5806852e05d4eeffecf9fd) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - warn when `chatRecovery` is configured in `onStart()` (applied too late for wake recovery)

  On every Durable Object wake the SDK evaluates chat-recovery budgets — and may seal an interrupted turn, firing `onExhausted` — **before** the user's `onStart()` runs (`_checkRunFibers()` is ordered ahead of `onStart()`). A `chatRecovery` config produced inside `onStart()` is therefore read as the built-in defaults at the moment recovery decides, so a configured `maxRecoveryWork` / `shouldKeepRecovering` / `onExhausted` silently never applies to the recovery that matters.

  This is now documented on `ChatRecoveryConfig` and the `chatRecovery` fields of `Think` / `AIChatAgent`, and the SDK logs a one-time warning if it detects `chatRecovery` being reassigned during `onStart()`. The warning fires both for a custom config object and for `chatRecovery = true` (enabling recovery / its defaults too late); assigning `false` (disabling) in `onStart()` is intentionally not warned, since recovery already ran with the pre-`onStart()` value and disabling it afterward is a benign no-op for that wake. The fix is to assign `chatRecovery` as a class field or in the constructor.

- [#1684](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1684) [`ab6dd95`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/ab6dd95b791a60fe5a5806852e05d4eeffecf9fd) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix(chat-recovery): don't seal a human-in-the-loop turn that is waiting on a pending client tool call

  A turn parked on a pending CLIENT interaction — an `input-available` client-tool part (no server `execute`) or an `approval-requested` part, as detected by `hasPendingInteraction()` — is _waiting on the human_, not stuck. After a mid-turn Durable Object restart (e.g. a deploy), the in-memory pending-interaction promise is gone, so `waitUntilStable()` repeatedly times out until the client reconnects and replays the tool-result/approval. That replay drives a fresh continuation via the auto-continuation barrier independently of recovery — but the recovery loop was treating those timeouts as deploy churn:

  - each stable-state timeout burned a recovery attempt, eventually sealing a perfectly healthy turn with `reason="stable_timeout"`, and
  - the no-progress window (which never advances while no content is produced) could seal it with `reason="no_progress_timeout"` once it elapsed.

  The net effect: an interrupted human-in-the-loop turn whose user simply took longer than the configured `noProgressTimeoutMs` / attempt budget to answer a tool prompt was terminalized with a "session interrupted" banner, even though nothing had actually failed.

  While a client interaction is pending the turn is now **budget-free**:

  - `_beginChatRecoveryIncident` suppresses the no-progress window, attempt cap, work budget, and `shouldKeepRecovering` predicate, and keeps the no-progress clock fresh so the turn gets a full window once the human finally answers.
  - `_chatRecoveryContinue` / `_chatRecoveryRetry` **park** (mark the incident `skipped` with `reason="awaiting_client_interaction"`, resolving the live "recovering…" indicator) instead of rescheduling or exhausting — the client's eventual replay resumes the turn. A client that never returns is reclaimed by the incident TTL sweep and DO idle-eviction.

  In `@cloudflare/think`, a `submitMessages`-backed turn additionally has its durable submission row **completed** at park time. The recovery loop is that row's sole completion driver after a restart, and the client's replay resumes the conversation as an independent auto-continuation that never touches the submission — so parking without completing would leave the row `running`, and the next restart's `_recoverSubmissionsOnStart` would sweep it to `error` (a false "session recovery error"). The park condition is a fully-materialized client tool call in the leaf, which is exactly the terminal state a non-interrupted submission reaches when its step emits a client tool call (the model does not block on client tools), so `completed` is the correct, consistent outcome.

  SERVER-tool orphans are deliberately excluded (their `execute()` died with the isolate and nothing will resolve them), so they still recover normally via the transcript-repair pass.

  Both `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` (which carries its own copy of the recovery engine) are fixed. In `@cloudflare/think` the client/server distinction already lived in `hasPendingInteraction()`. `@cloudflare/ai-chat`'s `hasPendingInteraction()` (used by `waitUntilStable`) does not distinguish client from server tools, so a new, narrower client-only predicate `hasPendingClientInteraction()` was added there and gates the exemption — leaving `waitUntilStable`'s existing behavior untouched so server-tool orphans keep reschedule/exhaust semantics.

  The exemption depends on knowing the request's client tools. `@cloudflare/ai-chat` restores them in its constructor, so they are available when boot recovery evaluates budgets. `@cloudflare/think` restored them in `onStart()`, which the base `Agent` runs _after_ the boot-recovery path (`_handleInternalFiberRecovery` -> `_beginChatRecoveryIncident`) — so on a fresh wake the in-memory cache was still empty and a client-tool `input-available` orphan re-detected past the no-progress window was misread as "stuck" and wrongly sealed. `_beginChatRecoveryIncident` now re-hydrates `_lastClientTools` from the durable `think_config` store before evaluating the budget, closing that hibernation-ordering hole (`approval-requested` turns were never affected, since that branch does not depend on the client tool set).

- [#1672](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1672) [`f96a2ba`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f96a2bab7a668465b0e68c7f70b4b1b93ae53296) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix(chat-recovery): a turn making forward progress now survives unbounded deploy churn; add a work budget + `shouldKeepRecovering` runaway guard

  Durable chat recovery used to bound a single incident with a non-resetting 15-minute wall-clock ceiling (`CHAT_RECOVERY_MAX_WINDOW_MS`). That ceiling was overloaded — it served as both a recovery-duration bound and a runaway-loop guard — and it terminated _healthy, actively-progressing_ turns that simply took longer than 15 minutes of wall-clock to finish while being repeatedly interrupted by a dense deploy window, sealing them with `reason="max_recovery_window_exceeded"` and discarding completed work.

  The two jobs are now decoupled (see `design/rfc-chat-recovery-work-budget.md`):

  - **Duration is no longer a bound for a progressing turn.** The non-resetting wall-clock ceiling is removed. A turn that keeps producing content survives unbounded deploy churn. Stuck turns are still sealed by the no-progress window (5 min, resets on progress); tight no-progress alarm loops by the attempt cap.
  - **New runaway-loop guard, keyed to work, not time.** The existing durable, monotonic, reconnect-immune progress counter is reused as a work meter. `chatRecovery.maxRecoveryWork` caps the produced content/tool units since an incident opened; exceeding it seals with `reason="work_budget_exceeded"`. **Defaults to `Infinity`** — the SDK ships the mechanism but imposes no implicit cap, so it never terminates a progressing turn on its own.
  - **New caller predicate.** `chatRecovery.shouldKeepRecovering(ctx)` is consulted per recovery attempt from the second onward (only when no hard bound has already sealed the incident); returning `false` seals with `reason="recovery_aborted"`. This is where integrators express token/cost/step budgets the SDK should not hardcode. A throwing predicate is logged and treated as "keep recovering".
  - **The no-progress timeout is now configurable.** `chatRecovery.noProgressTimeoutMs` (default 5 min, resets on progress) is the primary stuck-turn bound, now overridable per agent instead of a hardcoded constant.

  New public types from `agents/chat`: `ChatRecoveryProgressContext`. New `ChatRecoveryConfig` fields: `maxRecoveryWork`, `shouldKeepRecovering`, `noProgressTimeoutMs`. `ChatRecoveryExhaustedContext.reason` gains `work_budget_exceeded` and `recovery_aborted`; `max_recovery_window_exceeded` is retained as an open-string value but is no longer emitted.

  Both `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think` (which carries its own copy of the recovery engine) are updated identically. Defaults are unchanged except that a progressing turn is no longer terminated by wall-clock age.

  Workflows that use `waitForApproval()` or `ThinkWorkflow.prompt()` now release their RPC stubs promptly, preventing resource leaks and the associated "RPC stub was not disposed" warnings in your logs.

- [#1670](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1670) [`5d64940`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/5d64940c2115822ef5ba4c8b35bfe5c2632ce11d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix: a deploy that interrupts an in-flight `runAgentTool` child no longer abandons the still-running child as `interrupted`.

  Parent recovery re-attaches to a still-running child and tails it to its real terminal. Previously that re-attach used a flat 120s wall-clock budget that was **not** reset by the child's forward progress, so a healthy child whose recovery legitimately ran longer than the budget was sealed `interrupted` (and its already-completed work re-run from scratch), even while it was actively streaming.

  The re-attach budget is now **progress-keyed**: it bounds how long the parent waits with _no_ forward progress from the child (resetting on every forwarded chunk), so a genuinely hung/silent child still seals `interrupted` after one no-progress window and can never block recovery forever, while a healthy child that keeps streaming is followed through to terminal. The parent re-arms (opens a fresh tail) **only when the child's stream closes cleanly while it is still advancing** — i.e. a re-evicted-but-progressing child. A full no-progress window (the child went silent) seals `no-progress` immediately even if the child streamed earlier in that window; it no longer grants a bonus window. This is both the honest stall signal and what keeps at most one pending tail reader alive per re-attach (no per-cycle reader accumulation).

  `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` additionally finalize a child facet's own agent-tool run row as soon as its recovered turn settles — regardless of whether recovery took the continue path (`_chatRecoveryContinue`) or the pre-stream retry path (`_chatRecoveryRetry`) — so a re-attached parent collects the terminal result immediately instead of waiting out a full no-progress window after the child has already finished.

  This release also adds:

  - **Typed interrupted cause.** `RunAgentToolResult`, the `agentTool()` `AgentToolFailure` envelope, the `onAgentToolFinish` lifecycle result, and the `agent-tool-event` wire event (kind `"interrupted"`) now carry a machine-readable `reason` (`AgentToolInterruptedReason`: `"no-progress" | "window-exceeded" | "not-tailable" | "inspect-timeout" | "inspect-failed" | "recovery-deadline"`) and a `childStillRunning` boolean on `interrupted` results, so callers (and UIs) can branch on _why_ a run was abandoned (and whether the child is still running) instead of pattern-matching the human-readable `error` prose. `retryable` stays coarse (always `true` for `interrupted`); refine with `reason` / `childStillRunning`. These fields are **persisted** (schema bump), so they survive a reconnect replay — a client that reconnects after an interrupt reconstructs the same `reason` / `childStillRunning` a live client saw, rather than `undefined`. The persisted cause is cleared when a soft `interrupted` row is later repaired to `completed`/`error`.
  - **Configurable re-attach budgets.** Two new public `AgentStaticOptions` — `agentToolReattachNoProgressTimeoutMs` (default 120000, the progress-keyed no-progress budget) and `agentToolReattachMaxWindowMs` (default **`Infinity`** — no implicit wall-clock cap) — let an Agent tune re-attach. The hard ceiling defaults to uncapped to mirror chat-recovery's `maxRecoveryWork: Infinity`: a re-attached parent follows a healthy, still-advancing child for as long as it makes progress — exactly as it would on the live (never-evicted) path — so it never abandons a long-running-but-healthy child that simply outlasts a fixed wall clock under deploy churn. A hung/silent child is bounded by the no-progress budget; a content-runaway is bounded uniformly (live and recovery) by the child's own `maxRecoveryWork` / `shouldKeepRecovering`. Integrators that want a hard wall-clock cap (and the `window-exceeded` child teardown it triggers) can set `agentToolReattachMaxWindowMs` to a finite value. Symmetrically, setting `agentToolReattachNoProgressTimeoutMs` to `Infinity` now means **"never seal on no-progress"** (a silent-but-alive child is followed until its stream closes or the hard ceiling fires) instead of silently skipping the wait — `0` remains the "don't wait, collect only an already-terminal child" sentinel.
  - **Give-up teardown (ceiling only).** When the parent gives up at the hard `window-exceeded` ceiling — where the child has had its full recovery window and is truly exhausted — it now cancels the child (`childStillRunning: false`) so it stops consuming a fiber / keep-alive. `no-progress` give-ups stay **soft** (`childStillRunning: true`): the child is left running so a re-issue can still re-attach and repair it if it self-heals, preserving the repair-on-re-issue path. In both `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat`, `cancelAgentToolRun` also aborts an in-flight chat-recovery turn (not just the original in-isolate run) and releases live tails — Think sweeps its `_submissionAbortControllers`, ai-chat its request `AbortRegistry` (`abortAllRequests`) — so a torn-down child stops grinding instead of finishing an orphaned recovered turn.

  Compaction only fires between turns (`Session.compactAfter` checks the threshold on `appendMessage`). A single long, tool-heavy turn grows the prompt step-by-step inside one `streamText` loop and can exceed the model's context window mid-turn, before the next pre-turn check — the provider then 400s (`"prompt is too long"` / `context_length_exceeded`) and the turn dies terminally. Think deliberately ships no provider-specific error matching, so it could neither detect nor recover from this.

  This adds opt-in, provider-agnostic recovery (all default off — no behavior change unless enabled), configured through a single `contextOverflow` property on `Think`:

  - **`classifyChatError(error, ctx)`** — the app maps a raw error (or the in-stream error string) to a `ChatErrorClassification` (`"context_overflow" | "rate_limit" | "transient" | "fatal" | "unknown"`). Same framework-owns-the-mechanism / app-owns-the-provider-knowledge split as `tokenCounter`. The classification is also threaded to `onChatError`/observers via `ChatErrorContext.classification`. The bundled, exported `defaultContextOverflowClassifier` covers the common providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Bedrock, …) for apps that do not need custom classification.
  - **`contextOverflow.reactive`** + **`contextOverflow.maxRetries`** — when a turn fails with a `context_overflow` the app classified, Think discards the truncated partial, runs `session.compact()`, and re-runs the turn (bounded) from the compacted history instead of dying. The partial is intentionally not persisted: the retry restarts the turn from scratch, so keeping the cut-off partial would orphan a half-finished assistant message beside the recovered answer (and duplicate any tool work the retry re-issues). A no-op compaction or a spent budget surfaces the overflow terminally through `onChatError` with `classification: "context_overflow"` — never a silent end, never an infinite loop. Wired into the WebSocket, `chat()`/RPC, and programmatic (`saveMessages`/`submitMessages`) turn paths.
  - **`contextOverflow.proactive`** — a `{ maxInputTokens, headroom?, maxCompactions? }` pre-step guard: when the previous step's model-reported `usage.inputTokens` crosses `maxInputTokens * (headroom ?? 0.9)`, Think compacts in place and feeds the recompacted history into the upcoming step, heading off the provider 400 before it happens. Keys off model-reported usage (every provider reports it), not provider error strings. Bounded per step loop by its own `maxCompactions` (default 1, independent of the reactive `maxRetries` budget).

  Also adds a `chat:context:compacted` observability event (`agents`) emitted (once) on both proactive and reactive compaction.

  Notes:

  - Provider context-overflow errors always surface as in-stream error parts (confirmed against the AI SDK: `streamText` re-enqueues even top-level rejections as `{ type: "error" }` fullStream parts, and `toUIMessageStream` passes them through without throwing), so the in-stream seam catches them on every path; the thrown-error catch path does not need separate wiring.
  - Recovery effectiveness depends on the app's compaction config — a no-op compaction cannot rescue an over-budget turn (handled gracefully: terminal, not a loop). A one-time warning fires if `contextOverflow.reactive` is enabled but `classifyChatError` was never overridden.

### Patch Changes

- [#1667](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1667) [`919bfaa`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/919bfaa35c95e94302bad443f070b015bcaf4cb7) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix(think): make the parallel-tool auto-continuation barrier event-driven ([#1650](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1650), follow-up to [#1649](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1649))

  [#1649](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1649) added a barrier so auto-continuation waits for all of a step's parallel client-tool results before firing, but bounded the wait with a fixed 60s timeout that fired through on expiry. That timeout was the wrong primary mechanism: a human-in-the-loop tool with no `execute` (an `ask_user`/`display_ui`-style prompt) emitted in parallel with a fast tool legitimately parks at `input-available` for minutes, so the barrier would fire through and repair the still-open tool to errored while the user was answering. Orphans (a client disconnecting mid-batch) also pinned the isolate alive via `keepAlive` for the full 60s.

  Auto-continuation is only ever triggered by a tool-result/approval event, so the barrier is now purely event-driven. When the coalesce timer fires on an incomplete batch, Think drains the in-flight applies, re-checks, and — if a sibling is still unanswered — returns without firing and without holding the isolate, leaving the pending continuation in place. The next sibling's result re-arms the timer (or, after eviction, re-creates the pending state from the persisted transcript) and re-runs the check; the continuation fires exactly once when the final sibling lands. A legitimately slow human answer never fires through to a spurious error, a true orphan never auto-continues and never pins the isolate, and the case is self-healing across hibernation. This removes `AUTO_CONTINUATION_PENDING_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS` (and its `console.warn`) from the Think path entirely.

  Because the barrier now keys off events rather than polling message state, it also handles the case where the result that completes a parallel batch is an errored one: the client sends `autoContinue: false` for an errored tool result, so that event no longer schedules a continuation. When a sibling has already opted in (a pending continuation exists), such a result now re-arms the barrier check so the batch still continues exactly once — without ever creating a continuation for a standalone errored tool.

  Crucially, this also fixes [#1649](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1649)'s headline race (`MissingToolResultsError`): the model emits parallel tool calls sequentially within one step, so a fast client tool can resolve and round-trip a result to the server **while the model is still streaming the slower siblings** — at which point those siblings exist nowhere (not in the persisted transcript, not in the in-flight accumulator), so no batch check can see them and the barrier fires prematurely. The continuation then repairs the later-materialized siblings to errored. The barrier now holds while the assistant turn is streaming (`_streamingAssistant != null`) and re-checks when the stream finalizes (`_onStreamingTurnFinalized`) — which also covers the all-fast batch whose every result landed mid-stream, where there is no later tool-result event to re-arm it.

  `@cloudflare/ai-chat` keeps the bounded-wait barrier for now (its barrier runs inside the queued continuation turn and can't return-and-wait without occupying the chat-turn queue); making it event-driven requires moving the batch gate before queueing, tracked alongside the think↔ai-chat unification ([#1642](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1642)).

  The RPC streaming path (`_streamResultToRpcCallback`) re-armed the auto-continuation coalesce timer in its `finally` even on the stream-stall recovery early-returns (`scheduled`/`exhausted`), unlike the WebSocket `_streamResult` recovery paths which deliberately do a plain `_streamingAssistant = null` without re-arming. When a parallel tool batch had a pending continuation at the moment the stall watchdog fired, that re-arm could fire a second continuation alongside the alarm-scheduled recovery continuation — a spurious double model invocation on the turn queue. The RPC recovery early-returns now mirror the WebSocket path (plain clear, no re-arm); the scheduled recovery continuation re-runs the turn and its own stream finalize re-triggers the held barrier exactly once.

  The serialization fix in [#1657](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1657) stopped parallel results from clobbering each other, but a deeper window remained: during a streaming turn the assistant message lives only in the in-flight `StreamAccumulator` until `_persistAssistantMessage` writes it at the turn boundary. The `tool-input-available` chunk is broadcast to the client mid-stream, so a fast client can resolve the tool and send `cf_agent_tool_result` before the message is ever persisted. `_applyToolUpdateToMessages` only scanned durable storage, so the apply silently no-op'd, the end-of-stream persist then wrote `input-available`, and the auto-continuation's transcript repair errored the call with "The tool call was interrupted before a result was recorded."

  `_applyToolUpdateToMessages` now applies the update to the in-flight accumulator (in place, so it rides into the eventual persist) in addition to durable storage, mirroring `@cloudflare/ai-chat`'s `_streamingMessage` handling. The accumulator is exposed via `_streamingAssistant` for the duration of each streaming turn and cleared on every exit path and on `resetTurnState`. Applying to both locations is monotonic, so a stall-recovery partial persist can't downgrade an already-applied result back to `input-available`.

- [#1661](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1661) [`41315b6`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/41315b602c4d68dbd5cad99cc949fbf13e256c51) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Unwedge sessions corrupted by a malformed `tool_use.input`, and make the failure observable.

  1. **Read-side repair gap.** Transcript repair already normalized a `null`/`undefined`/stringified-JSON tool input, but left an empty string `""`, an array, and other non-object primitives untouched — so a session that persisted one of those shapes before the write-side guard shipped kept 400ing forever with `tool_use.input: Input should be an object` (Anthropic rejects array inputs the same way it rejects `""`/`null`). `_normalizeToolInput` now delegates to the shared `normalizeToolInput`, collapsing any non-object input to `{}` so the pre-send repair pass rescues the session on its next turn.

  2. **Observability.** An AI-SDK provider error surfaces as a stream error part, not a thrown exception, so it took the in-band `error` branch that emitted `message:error` but never `chat:request:failed`. That branch now also emits `chat:request:failed` (`stage: "stream"`), so observers and turn-count telemetry see the post-`beforeTurn`, in-stream failure class without needing to know whether the error threw or arrived as a chunk.

- [#1657](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1657) [`7bff8d7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7bff8d74c927a53ec11ee4a89dc6cff6b63db0ad) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix(think): serialize parallel client-tool result/approval applies so siblings aren't clobbered ([#1649](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1649) follow-up)

  The auto-continuation barrier added in [#1651](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1651) stopped premature continuation, but a deeper race remained in Think. Each `tool-result`/`tool-approval` WebSocket message fired an independent read-modify-write of the whole assistant message, and `_applyToolUpdateToMessages` awaits a storage read before its write. When the model fanned out parallel tool calls, the concurrent applies all read the same `input-available` snapshot, each patched only its own part, and the last write clobbered its siblings back to `input-available`. The continuation barrier then timed out and the transcript-repair backstop errored the lost calls with "The tool call was interrupted before a result was recorded."

  Applies are now chained off a serialization tail so each read-modify-write commits atomically in arrival order. `_pendingInteractionPromise` still tracks the newest link, so the barrier's single-slot wake-up transitively waits for every predecessor.

  The same serialization is applied to `@cloudflare/ai-chat` defensively: its apply is currently synchronous (no await between the message read and the SQLite write), so it does not exhibit this clobber today, but the queue keeps the invariant safe if that ever changes.

- [#1659](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1659) [`f99f890`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f99f89022ced86115fa81f652e49ecb74340dbf2) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix two chat-recovery failures that could leave a turn wedged at a half-finished assistant message after a deploy/eviction, with no terminal banner.

  1. **Server-tool recovery deadlock.** When a server-side tool's `execute()` was interrupted by an eviction, the recovered turn's orphaned tool part was left at `input-available` — but no client `tool-result` will ever arrive for a server tool, so `waitUntilStable` could never converge. The recovery continuation burned its whole attempt budget on a wait that could not succeed. `waitUntilStable` now treats an `input-available` part as pending only when it is genuinely client-resolvable (a registered client tool whose result the SPA can replay, or an `approval-requested` part). A dead server-tool orphan no longer blocks stability, so recovery converges and the existing transcript-repair pass flips the orphan to an errored result and the model continues the turn.

  2. **Silent seal on a thrown recovery callback.** A non-reset error thrown by `_chatRecoveryContinue` / `_chatRecoveryRetry` was re-thrown and then swallowed by the scheduler, which deleted the one-shot recovery alarm row — terminating the turn with no `onExhausted` event and no terminal banner. The recovery callbacks now terminalize a non-reset throw through the same exhaustion path (firing `onExhausted` with reason `recovery_error` and delivering the `terminalMessage`), while still re-throwing a genuine Durable Object code-update reset so the platform re-runs recovery on the fresh isolate. The terminal banner is also now broadcast before the bookkeeping storage writes in the exhaustion path, and those writes are best-effort, so a storage failure during give-up can no longer suppress the user-visible terminalization.

### Minor Changes

- [#1636](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1636) [`f5a0d00`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f5a0d00cf59b19cd4db54c7de6e441b8da669521) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Expose recovery incident identity and enrich the `onExhausted` payload so
  products can build a terminal-state policy without re-deriving anything ([#1631](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1631)).

  - `ChatRecoveryContext` (the `onChatRecovery` argument) now includes
    `recoveryRootRequestId` — the stable request ID for the whole continuation
    chain. Unlike `requestId`, it doesn't change across chained continuations, so
    it's the right key for per-incident budget tracking / fresh-incident detection
    without re-deriving identity from message IDs.
  - `ChatRecoveryExhaustedContext` (the `onExhausted` argument) now carries
    `recoveryRootRequestId`, `terminalMessage` (the exact text shown to the user),
    `partialText` / `partialParts` (what the turn produced before it was given up
    on), and `streamId` / `createdAt` — enough to render or persist a user-facing
    terminal banner AND emit correlated terminal telemetry (e.g. time-since-turn-start,
    stream correlation) directly, without re-deriving anything.

  All fields are additive. Applied across `agents` (shared types),
  `@cloudflare/think`, and `@cloudflare/ai-chat`.

- [#1584](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1584) [`87006e2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/87006e27498ee535feabd2a9bd207366f33621be) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add a framework-agnostic Agent Skills engine at `agents/skills`: skill sources (`fromManifest`, R2), a `SkillRegistry` that produces a catalog prompt and AI SDK activation tools (`activate_skill`, `read_skill_resource`, `run_skill_script`), binary-safe resource reads, and qualified cross-skill resource paths. Bundled skills are imported through the Agents Vite plugin with the `agents:skills` specifier (defaulting to a `./skills` directory), typed via ambient declarations shipped from `agents`. `@cloudflare/think` re-exports the engine as `skills` and wires `getSkills()` into the turn; any AI SDK caller (including `@cloudflare/ai-chat`) can build a `SkillRegistry` directly.

  Skill loading is resilient: duplicate or failing sources are skipped with a warning (first source wins) instead of throwing. Optional, experimental script execution (`skills.runner`) runs function-style JavaScript/TypeScript (`export default run(input, ctx)` with `ctx = { skill, files, workspace, tools, output }`) plus path-based Python and Bash, all behind a single capability and permission bridge.

  When a durable chat turn is interrupted (a deploy/eviction, or a stream-stall
  watchdog abort) and resumes, clients had no "in progress" signal — the turn
  looked frozen until it completed or a terminal error was replayed. A new
  `cf_agent_chat_recovering` protocol frame is now broadcast on recovery schedule
  and cleared on every terminal outcome (completed/skipped/failed/exhausted), so
  the indicator can't spin forever. In `@cloudflare/think` it's also persisted and
  replayed on connect, so a client that joins mid-recovery learns the turn is
  working. `useAgentChat` exposes a new `isRecovering` flag (distinct from
  `isStreaming` — a recovering turn isn't producing tokens yet); most UIs render
  `isStreaming || isRecovering` as "busy". Backward-compatible: clients that don't
  understand the frame ignore it.

  > Note: `@cloudflare/ai-chat` broadcasts the live signal but does not yet replay
  > it on connect (it has no idle-connect hydration path; tracked in [#1645](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1645)).
  > `@cloudflare/think` has both.

  For recovery telemetry, subscribe to the `chat:recovery:*` observability events

  - Add shared chat recovery incident tracking with attempt counts, configurable `chatRecovery` defaults, and terminal exhaustion behavior for `AIChatAgent` and `Think`. Think recovery now exhausts after six failed attempts by default and sends a terminal error frame instead of spinning indefinitely.
  - Keep the recovery attempt budget bounded even when an interrupted turn flips between `retry` and `continue` recovery kinds (the incident identity no longer includes the kind), guard a throwing `onExhausted` hook so the terminal UX is still delivered, mark incidents `failed` when the recovery dispatch throws, and reclaim incident records on success plus a TTL sweep for abandoned ones so durable storage does not grow without bound.
  - Bound generic unmanaged fiber recovery with a configurable `fiberRecoveryMaxAgeMs` so a repeatedly-throwing `onFiberRecovered()` hook cannot re-trigger forever across restarts.
  - Surface Think post-persist chat request failures through `onChatError(error, ctx)` and `chat:request:failed`.
  - Repair incomplete Think tool-call transcripts before provider calls and allow `createCompactFunction()` to use a supplied token counter for tail budgeting.

- [#1638](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1638) [`b6c8dea`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b6c8dea255aff6b2c0fe0e30068c143c5eac6334) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Make chat recovery's budget wall-clock-keyed-to-progress instead of raw attempt
  count, so a healthy turn under deploy churn isn't sealed prematurely ([#1637](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1637)).

  Under continuous deploys the attempt count is the wrong primary bound: one
  rollout drops/reconnects the socket several times (~11–22s), each firing a
  recovery alarm, so the count inflated far faster than the real interruption rate
  and exhausted turns that were still advancing (0/23 model calls errored in the
  reported incident — it was pure eviction churn).

  Now:

  - **Primary bound: a 5-minute no-progress wall clock** keyed to `lastProgressAt`,
    which resets on every progress-bearing attempt. A turn that keeps producing
    content survives churn indefinitely; one that genuinely goes quiet is sealed
    within 5 minutes.
  - **Alarm debounce (~30s):** recovery alarms bunched within the window (a single
    rollout's reconnect storm) collapse into one attempt.
  - **Attempt cap is now a high secondary backstop** (default raised 6 → 10),
    resets on progress; it only catches a pathological tight alarm-loop.
  - The existing 15-minute absolute incident-age ceiling is kept as the final
    non-resetting hard stop.
  - **Progress signal moved to production time** (when new content is durably
    flushed/streamed) instead of persist time — so it advances only on genuinely
    new content and is immune to client reconnects and recovery re-persists, which
    the no-progress window depends on. (Builds on the compaction-immune counter
    from [#1628](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1628).)

  Applies to both `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat`, including the
  `TaskSubAgent`/sub-agent recovery path.

  The messenger runtime depends directly on Chat SDK, supports provider-specific adapter names for multi-bot setups, and exposes the Telegram provider as both a named and default export.

- [#1643](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1643) [`bc86dce`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/bc86dcee955eea7f0dbfa1b117b4f7b98330ba2a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Route a stream-stall watchdog abort into bounded recovery instead of a terminal error ([#1626](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1626))

  When `chatStreamStallTimeoutMs` is set and the inactivity watchdog fires on a
  hung model/transport stream, the turn is no longer failed terminally. Because a
  stall is just another interruption — like a deploy or eviction — it is now
  routed into the **same bounded chat-recovery path**: the settled partial is
  preserved, a continuation is scheduled, and the turn resumes. A transient hang
  (the common case under deploy churn) recovers automatically; a persistently
  hanging provider still terminalizes once the recovery budget is exhausted (the
  watchdog's original "kill the infinite spinner" guarantee, now after bounded
  retries). Exhaustion goes through the **same** `_exhaustChatRecovery` path as
  deploy-recovery exhaustion, so your configured `terminalMessage` is delivered,
  `onExhausted` fires, and the `chat:recovery:exhausted` event is emitted — rather
  than leaking the raw `"Chat stream stalled…"` error.

  This is automatic whenever the watchdog is enabled and `chatRecovery` is on
  (the Think default) — no new configuration. Idempotency matches deploy
  recovery: settled tool results are durable and are not re-run, but a tool that
  was mid-execution when the stall fired re-runs on the continuation. With
  `chatRecovery` disabled, a stall stays terminal as before.

  Also adds a per-turn `TurnConfig.chatStreamStallTimeoutMs` override (returned
  from `beforeTurn`): a turn known to invoke a slow tool can raise or disable
  (`0`) the watchdog for that turn only, instead of permanently widening the
  instance-level window. It auto-resets after the turn.

- [#1647](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1647) [`0b29be5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/0b29be5345c6b7e37d8f9dfefc0dcac710423ff1) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `StreamCallback.onInterrupted()` so a `chat()`-driven turn interrupted by recovery isn't silently abandoned

  When a turn driven through `chat(userMessage, callback)` is interrupted and routed
  into bounded recovery (a stream-stall watchdog abort), the scheduled continuation
  runs in a **later isolate invocation without the original callback** — so neither
  `onDone()` nor `onError()` ever fires for that callback. Because the isolate is
  still alive, the RPC promise resolves **cleanly**, and a consumer that keys off the
  clean resolve mis-reads it as success: it finalizes whatever partial it had
  streamed. For the built-in messenger delivery this meant posting a **truncated**
  answer as final, while the real recovered answer was produced later and broadcast
  only to WebSocket connections.

  `StreamCallback` now has an optional `onInterrupted?()` signal, emitted from the
  stall→recovery branches of the RPC stream path instead of returning silently. It
  means "not done, not a terminal error — a continuation owns the final outcome";
  consumers should keep the channel open / show a recovering state / re-attach
  rather than finalizing the partial. It is **optional**, so existing
  `StreamCallback` implementers are unaffected.

  Messenger delivery is wired to it: an interrupted reply now surfaces an
  "interrupted, please retry" message instead of finalizing the truncated partial.

  Note: a deploy/eviction interruption kills the isolate (and the callback) before
  this can fire — the caller observes a transport break instead. `onInterrupted`
  covers the in-isolate stall→recovery path.

- [#1598](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1598) [`f5e37bf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f5e37bfa313634105fd0bdb7912498f9f92b24c6) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `ThinkWorkflow` with durable `step.prompt()` support for Workflow-owned Think reasoning steps.

- [#1635](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1635) [`5995fa8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/5995fa84bf6fc5a115d40d7ed9c6e9ec2e781de7) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add a `repairInterruptedToolPart` hook so subclasses can control how an
  interrupted tool call is repaired during transcript repair ([#1631](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1631)).

  Transcript repair flips a tool call with no settled result to an errored
  tool-result (preserving the record and keeping the provider from 400ing). That
  is the right default for server tools, but wrong for client-resolved tools like
  `ask_user` — a question with no server `execute`, answered by the user's next
  message — where the interrupted call _is_ a question and should be preserved as
  text so the model sees normal Q→A conversation and compaction keeps the prompt
  verbatim. Because repair runs (and persists) before `beforeTurn`, a subclass had
  no way to shape this for the current turn.

  `repairInterruptedToolPart(part)` defaults to the existing errored-result
  behavior and runs during repair, so an override (e.g. converting an interrupted
  `ask_user` into a text part carrying the prompt) takes effect on the same turn,
  not just the next one.

- [#1623](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1623) [`4c8b371`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c8b3712b11d2b07298e384e5884844272f4697a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add an opt-in inactivity watchdog for the streaming read loop, so a hung provider/transport surfaces a terminal error instead of an infinite spinner.

  Previously, if a model stream parked without ever throwing — no chunk, no error, no `done` — the chat read loop would wait forever and the client would spin indefinitely. There was no detection for a silently hung turn (only recovery-path `stable_timeout`, which guards recovery scheduling, not a live stream).

  Set `chatStreamStallTimeoutMs` on a Think subclass to arm it: if no UI-message-stream chunk arrives within that window, the watchdog aborts the turn and the loop exits with a terminal stream error (routed through `onChatError` with `stage: "stream"`), emitting a new `chat:stream:stalled` observability event.

  It is **off by default** (`0`) and applies to both the WebSocket turn loop and the `chat()` / sub-agent callback loop. Note it measures the gap _between_ stream chunks, which includes server-side tool execution time (no chunks flow while a tool runs) — set it comfortably above your slowest model time-to-first-token and slowest tool, or you will abort healthy long turns. A good starting point is `120_000`.

### Patch Changes

- [#1634](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1634) [`a4225fd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a4225fd9044ff096a29b4b36ad6cccb6b5484164) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Stop chat recovery from discarding settled work when a turn is given up on
  ([#1631](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1631)).

  Two paths could throw away a partial assistant message containing completed,
  often non-idempotent tool results:

  - When the framework's own recovery budget was exhausted, `_exhaustChatRecovery`
    sealed the turn (terminal status + banner) **before** the orphaned stream was
    ever persisted — so every settled tool result the turn had produced was lost
    and the model re-ran them on the next message. Exhaustion now persists the
    settled partial first, using the same gating as the normal recovery path so it
    can't duplicate an already-saved partial.
  - A subclass `onChatRecovery` returning `{ persist: false }` to stop a turn used
    to silently drop the settled partial. Settled work is now **never** dropped:
    `persist: false` only suppresses persistence of a partial that has nothing
    settled to lose; a partial carrying settled tool results is persisted
    regardless. An app can no longer accidentally discard completed work — and it
    never needs `{ persist: true }` just to stay safe. (A safe default beats a
    warning about an unsafe one.)

  Applied identically to `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat`.

- [#1633](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1633) [`1aca578`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/1aca578fe2329e38e19d6723e64f86743cda083d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix chat recovery prematurely exhausting its retry budget under compaction
  ([#1628](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1628)). The deploy-churn forward-progress signal — which resets the recovery
  budget when an interrupted turn is actually advancing — was recomputed from the
  live transcript by counting assistant messages. Compaction collapses older
  assistant messages into a summary, lowering that count, so a turn that had
  genuinely advanced could read as "no progress" between recovery attempts and
  exhaust at `maxAttempts`, sealing a healthy turn. Progress is now tracked by a
  durable, monotonic counter incremented when `_persistOrphanedStream` materializes
  a non-empty partial (the exact event the message count was proxying for), so
  compaction can never lower it. A turn that genuinely fails to advance still
  exhausts at the cap, and the 15-minute wall-clock ceiling is unchanged.

- [#1615](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1615) [`51a771f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/51a771ff7a640eae4b530b588d0f741300ddb0dc) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Chat recovery no longer permanently abandons a turn under repeated deploys. A
  mid-turn deploy resets the Durable Object ("code was updated") and the
  interrupted continuation is re-detected on the next wake; previously every such
  interruption consumed one of the bounded recovery attempts, so a deploy every
  few minutes exhausted the budget (`max_attempts_exceeded`) and the turn was
  terminally abandoned even though each fresh isolate was healthy. Recovery now
  distinguishes an interruption that followed forward progress (more persisted
  assistant content than the previous attempt observed) — treated as environmental
  and not counted against the budget — from a turn that never advances, which still
  exhausts at `maxAttempts`. A 15-minute wall-clock ceiling per incident bounds the
  worst case so a continuously churning environment cannot retry forever.

- [#1618](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1618) [`e6b6c0b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e6b6c0b91b55e12e5cf4ced0719938155d845720) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Chat continuation no longer fails on models that reject assistant-prefill.
  Continuing a partial assistant turn (e.g. after a deploy interrupts a stream)
  replayed a transcript whose final message was that partial assistant message.
  Modern chat models reject a request ending in an assistant message — Anthropic
  Claude 4.6+ returns a 400 ("This model does not support assistant message
  prefill. The conversation must end with a user message.") — so the continuation
  threw and the turn was left interrupted. Think now appends an ephemeral user
  "continue" checkpoint whenever a model request would otherwise end in an
  assistant message, so continuation works across providers. The checkpoint
  shapes only the model request and is never persisted to the transcript.

  ([#1649](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1649)). When the model emitted multiple tool calls in one step and the client
  resolved them independently via `addToolOutput`, a fast result's `autoContinue`
  could trigger the next inference while a slower sibling was still
  `input-available`. That fed the provider an incomplete tool-result set
  (`MissingToolResultsError`) or — via the transcript-repair backstop — silently
  flipped the in-flight sibling to errored and ran a spurious extra continuation.

  Auto-continuation now waits until the transcript is stable (no
  `input-available`/`approval-requested` parts) before continuing, so a fanned-out
  tool batch coalesces into a single continuation regardless of result arrival
  order. The wait is bounded, so a genuinely orphaned tool call (e.g. the client
  disconnected mid-batch) still falls through to the existing backstop instead of
  pinning the continuation open.

  user approves them. Think now keeps approved/denied/errored tool parts in the
  model transcript, updates its live transcript before an immediate continuation,
  and persists and broadcasts terminal tool output emitted for a prior assistant
  message. Continuation response frames are also labelled consistently so
  `useAgentChat` can apply streamed continuation updates to the active UI state.
  A pending `approval-responded` tool is no longer mis-reported by the
  incomplete-tool-call backstop, so approval continuations stop logging a false
  "repair gap" warning and emitting a spurious `chat:transcript:repaired` event.

  The cross-message tool result now flows through `StreamAccumulator`'s
  `cross-message-tool-update` action and a shared, replay-safe
  `crossMessageToolResultUpdate` builder (exported from `agents/chat`): it matches
  terminal states for first-write-wins idempotency against provider replays (e.g.
  the OpenAI Responses API, [#1404](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1404)), preserves a streamed `preliminary` flag, and
  lets `Think` skip redundant writes/broadcasts when a result is already settled.

  A parent turn whose work is "run a sub-agent and await its result" produced no
  recoverable content of its own, so under deploy churn the **parent's** own
  chat-recovery no-progress window could exhaust while the child was still
  healthily streaming — abandoning the turn as `interrupted` and collecting an
  interrupted result even though the child went on to complete. (Reproduced by
  the `examples/deploy-churn --mode subagent` harness: the parent exhausted at
  `attempt 6/6` with `progress: 1` while the child self-healed all 30 steps.)

  Forwarding a child's stream to the parent's connections is now treated as
  genuine forward progress for the parent's recovery budget: `Think` and
  `AIChatAgent` advance their durable recovery-progress marker (throttled) each
  time `_forwardAgentToolStream` forwards child output, so a parent that keeps
  re-attaching to and streaming a live child survives churn indefinitely. The
  credit is only granted when the child actually produces output — a silent or
  hung child still lets the parent exhaust on its own no-progress timer, so a
  stuck sub-agent can never pin a parent's recovery open forever.

  This completes the sub-agent recovery story started by the stable-runId +
  bounded re-attach fix ([#1630](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1630)): the child self-heals and the parent both
  re-attaches to it _and_ keeps its own recovery alive while doing so.

- [#1621](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1621) [`fac4463`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/fac44632a26530412dd2457164fa58140b9bef48) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Settled tool results are now flushed to durable storage immediately during a
  chat turn, so recovery never re-runs an already-completed (often non-idempotent)
  tool call. Stream chunks are batched in memory and flushed to SQLite every ~10
  chunks; the WebSocket chat path did not force a flush on settled tool results,
  so an isolate eviction (deploy) before the next batch flush lost them. Recovery
  then rebuilt the partial assistant message without those tool calls and the
  model re-ran them (e.g. duplicate INSERTs). The sub-agent RPC streaming path
  already flushed recoverable content; this brings the WebSocket path to parity
  via a shared `_storeChunkDurably` helper that flushes immediately on
  `tool-output-available` / `tool-output-error`. Net effect: recovery loses at
  most the single in-flight step, even when multiple evictions hit one turn.

  Also closes two remaining "frozen turn" hydration gaps from the terminal-status
  work: a turn that fails before the stream starts (e.g. a message reconciliation
  error in `_handleChatRequest`) now records its terminal status, and a recovery
  skip caused by `onChatRecovery` returning `{ continue: false }` now surfaces a
  terminal error too. Both were previously broadcast (or silent) but not persisted,
  so a client disconnected at that moment stayed frozen on reconnect. Benign skips
  such as `conversation_changed` (a newer turn already owns the UI) remain silent.

- [#1623](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1623) [`4c8b371`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c8b3712b11d2b07298e384e5884844272f4697a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Transcript repair now preserves an interrupted/abandoned tool call as an errored result instead of deleting it.

  Previously, a tool call with no recorded output (e.g. a tool interrupted mid-execution by a deploy, or an `ask_user` answered by the user's next message) was **removed** from the durable transcript before the next turn. That made the call visibly "disappear" from the broadcast transcript and let the model silently **re-run** it (duplicating non-idempotent side effects).

  It is now flipped to `state: "output-error"` with an explanatory message, so:

  - the user-visible record survives (no disappearing tool calls),
  - the model sees the tool errored rather than re-running it blind, and
  - the provider still receives a valid tool-result (no `AI_MissingToolResultsError`).

  Malformed tool `input`s are normalized in the same pass: a stringified-JSON `input` is parsed back into an object, and a missing/`null` `input` on a settled or interrupted tool call is defaulted to `{}` (Anthropic rejects a `tool_use` block whose `input` is absent).

  As a last-line backstop, `convertToModelMessages` is now called with `ignoreIncompleteToolCalls: true`, so any incomplete tool call that still slips past the repair (compaction edges, `addToolOutput` races, unrecognized part shapes) is dropped at conversion rather than 400ing the provider.

  Repair recognizes all of the AI SDK's settled terminal tool states — `output-available`, `output-error`, and `output-denied` (a user-denied approval) — via a single shared predicate, so a tool call that already has a provider-acceptable result is never re-flipped into a generic errored result. Previously `output-error` was re-flipped on every turn (clobbering a real `errorText` with the generic "interrupted" message and emitting spurious `chat:transcript:repaired` events/writes/broadcasts for the life of the conversation), and `output-denied` was converted into an errored result that lost the denial. A denied tool result is also now flushed to durable storage immediately (like other settled results) so it survives an eviction.

- [#1646](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1646) [`a245a4a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a245a4ad6fd0ad1a0fcd2609c8541109df8c6ad5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Terminalize a chat-recovery turn through `onExhausted` when it gives up waiting for stable state

  Under extreme churn (a long turn interrupted many times in quick succession), a
  recovery callback (`_chatRecoveryRetry` / `_chatRecoveryContinue`) could keep
  timing out waiting for the isolate to reach stable state until its retry budget
  drained. The give-up path only marked the incident `failed` and completed the
  recovered submission as `error` — it **bypassed `_exhaustChatRecovery`**, so
  `onExhausted` never fired, the `chat:recovery:exhausted` event was not emitted,
  the configured `terminalMessage` banner was never delivered, and the terminal
  chat status was not recorded. Apps relying on `onExhausted` for the terminal
  banner saw an eternal spinner with no terminal signal.

  The stable-state-timeout give-up now routes through the **same**
  `_exhaustChatRecovery` path as deploy-recovery and stall exhaustion: it fires
  `onExhausted` (with `reason: "stable_timeout"`), emits `chat:recovery:exhausted`,
  marks the durable submission interrupted, records the terminal chat status, and
  delivers the `terminalMessage`. As an extra backstop against silent drops, the
  give-up also terminalizes when the incident record is missing (no `incidentId`,
  or it was swept/deleted before a stale alarm fired) by synthesizing a terminal
  incident from the recovery-root request id — so a turn can never be dropped with
  no terminal UX.

- [#1623](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1623) [`4c8b371`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4c8b3712b11d2b07298e384e5884844272f4697a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix chat recovery falsely marking a durable submission as `error` under repeated mid-turn deploys.

  When several deploys interrupt a single turn, recovery runs a _chain_ of continuations. Three bugs combined to leave the submission in `error` even when the turn actually completed every step:

  - **Lost ownership.** The submission link (`recoveredRequestId`) was derived from each continuation's own (fresh) requestId, so chained continuations dropped it — the continuation that finally completed the turn could no longer mark the submission `completed`.
  - **Stale-continuation clobber.** A superseded continuation tripped the `conversation_changed` guard because the leaf had advanced via recovery's _own_ forward progress (a new assistant message), not a new user turn, and overwrote the still-running submission to `error`.
  - **Premature `stable_timeout`.** A timeout while waiting for the isolate to settle (common while a deploy is in flight) failed the turn terminally at the first attempt.

  Now: submission ownership is keyed off the stable recovery root and threaded through the entire continuation chain (including the terminal abandon paths — recovery exhaustion and `{ continue: false }` — which previously marked the submission by the per-continuation requestId and so left a chained submission stuck `running`); a superseded continuation skips benignly (only a genuinely newer user turn marks the submission `skipped`, never `error`); and a stable-state timeout reschedules within the `maxAttempts` budget. A turn that completes under deploy churn now ends `completed`, not `error`.

  `@cloudflare/ai-chat` has the same recovery machinery but no durable-submission layer, so it receives the `stable_timeout` reschedule fix only: a transient stable-state timeout now retries within the attempt budget instead of permanently abandoning a recoverable turn at the first attempt.

- [#1619](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1619) [`6d1a8f9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6d1a8f9d89f7df2919d70d611c97d2e0bbf3f3d9) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Interrupted/failed chat turns are no longer silently "frozen" for clients that
  reconnect after the failure. The terminal `MSG_CHAT_RESPONSE` broadcast (on a
  turn error or exhausted recovery) is transient — a client disconnected at that
  moment (e.g. during a deploy / WebSocket reconnect storm) misses it, and on
  reconnect `onConnect` previously replayed only the current messages with no
  terminal signal, so the turn appeared stuck with no completed response and no
  error. Think now persists a durable record of the last terminal turn and
  replays it on connect, so a reconnecting client learns the turn failed. The
  record is cleared when a later turn completes; benign recovery skips (e.g.
  `conversation_changed`, where a newer turn owns the UI) are intentionally not
  surfaced.

- [#1640](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1640) [`edb126a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/edb126a72d1a6b52fa0057191d6d461ee902e914) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Re-attach to a still-running sub-agent (`agentTool()`) run on parent recovery instead of abandoning and re-running it ([#1630](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1630)).

  When a parent agent was interrupted (deploy / Durable Object eviction) while a child `agentTool()` run was still in flight, recovery marked the run `interrupted` within a ~5s window and the parent re-issued the task — re-running the child's already-completed work. For long-running children under continuous deploys this surfaced to users as "the agent went all the way back and lost the files it already wrote."

  Three changes fix this:

  - **Stable child runId.** `agentTool()` now derives the child `runId` from the (recovery-preserved) tool call id (`agent-tool:<toolCallId>`) instead of minting a fresh `nanoid` per call. A turn re-run by chat recovery now resolves to the **same** idempotent child facet rather than spawning a brand-new one, so completed child work is never re-run.
  - **Bounded re-attach.** A duplicate non-terminal `runId` (in `runAgentTool`) and a still-running child during startup reconciliation now **tail the live child to its real terminal result** and collect it, instead of immediately sealing `interrupted`. Re-attach is bounded by a generous wall-clock budget (`DEFAULT_AGENT_TOOL_REATTACH_TIMEOUT_MS`, 120s, internal): a child that keeps advancing toward terminal within the window is collected; a genuinely hung child still seals `interrupted` so recovery can never block forever.
  - **Durable child-run reconcile.** A child facet self-heals its interrupted turn via its own `chatRecovery`, but that recovery path never wrote the child's agent-tool run row — so after a real eviction the row stranded `running` (think) / was force-errored (ai-chat) and the parent could never collect the recovered result. Both `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` now reconcile a stale child-run row from the durable transcript on inspect: while recovery is still resolving the row stays `running`; once it settles, a completed assistant response surfaces as `completed` (so the parent collects the real result) and an empty/failed recovery as `error`. This keeps the child's own (working) recovery path untouched.

  No new public configuration. Adds an internal `agent_tool:recovery:reattach` observability event. `@cloudflare/think` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` child tails are now read-only on consumer detach (a parent's re-attach budget expiring never cancels the still-running child).

That's the intended signal — those older combinations are no longer tested in the monorepo.

- [#1411](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1411) [`2fa68be`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/2fa68bea891e1bd8f30839586c2519627f364b0c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `options.signal` to `Think.saveMessages` and `Think.continueLastTurn` for external cancellation of programmatic turns, plus protected `abortRequest(id)` / `abortAllRequests()` methods to replace bracket access into the private `_aborts` registry ([#1406](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1406)).

  `saveMessages` and `continueLastTurn` accept a second `SaveMessagesOptions` argument:

  ```typescript
  const result = await this.saveMessages(messages, {
    signal: controller.signal
  });
  if (result.status === "aborted") {
    // Inference loop terminated mid-stream; partial chunks persisted.
  }
  ```

  The signal is linked to Think's per-turn `AbortController` for the duration of the call. When it aborts:

  - the inference loop's signal aborts (the same path `chat-request-cancel` takes);
  - partial chunks already streamed are persisted to the resumable stream;
  - `saveMessages` resolves with `{ status: "aborted" }`;
  - `onChatResponse` fires with `status: "aborted"`.

  Pre-aborted signals short-circuit before any model work runs. Listeners are detached cleanly when the turn finishes, so passing the same long-lived `AbortSignal` to many turns (e.g. a parent chat-turn signal driving multiple sub-agent calls) is safe and leak-free.

  `abortRequest(id, reason?)` and `abortAllRequests()` are protected entry points for DO subclasses (e.g. RPC-driven helpers) that want to cancel turns without tracking ids — they replace the historical `(this as unknown as { _aborts: ... })._aborts.destroyAll()` workaround used by helper-as-sub-agent implementations.

  `SaveMessagesResult.status` now includes `"aborted"` alongside `"completed"` and `"skipped"`. Existing callers that only switch on `"completed"` are unaffected.

  **Limitations.**

  - `AbortSignal` cannot cross Durable Object RPC. Construct the controller inside the DO that calls `saveMessages`. To bridge a parent's intent into a child DO, return a `ReadableStream` from the child whose `cancel` callback aborts a per-turn controller — `examples/agents-as-tools` shows the canonical pattern.
  - The signal lives in memory only. If the DO hibernates mid-turn and `chatRecovery` is enabled, the recovered turn calls `continueLastTurn()` internally without the original signal — an abort fired after restart has no effect on the recovered turn.

  See [`cloudflare/agents#1406`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1406) for the motivating use case.

### Patch Changes

- [#1395](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1395) [`63cfae6`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/63cfae6345c5ddc54df5e2f78a19097b9b5462ff) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Share submit concurrency bookkeeping through `agents/chat` and use it from both chat agents.

  This extracts the `latest`/`merge`/`drop`/`debounce` admission state machine into a `SubmitConcurrencyController` exported from `agents/chat`. `AIChatAgent` semantics (including merge persistence) are preserved. `Think` now picks up the same pending-enqueue protection, so an overlapping submit is still detected while an accepted request is between admission and turn queue registration.

  Additional fixes:

  - `Think` now captures the turn generation immediately after admission and threads it into `_turnQueue.enqueue`, so a clear that lands between admission and queue registration cannot run a stale turn.
  - Pending-enqueue tracking is now bound to a release function tied to the controller's reset epoch, so a release from a pre-reset submit can no longer erase a post-reset submit's marker and let a third submit slip through as non-overlapping.
  - Debounce cancellation correctly resolves all in-flight waiters instead of overwriting a single timer slot.

- [#1394](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1394) [`a0a0d17`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a0a0d179a862547715b0dd2e38d37065f24eabe5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - think: add `beforeStep` lifecycle hook and `output` passthrough on `TurnConfig`.

  - **`beforeStep(ctx)`** — new lifecycle hook called before each AI SDK step in the agentic loop, wired to `streamText({ prepareStep })`. Receives a `PrepareStepContext` (the AI SDK's `PrepareStepFunction` parameter — `steps`, `stepNumber`, `model`, `messages`, `experimental_context`) and may return a `StepConfig` (`PrepareStepResult`) to override `model`, `toolChoice`, `activeTools`, `system`, `messages`, `experimental_context`, or `providerOptions` for the current step. Use `beforeTurn` for turn-wide assembly and `beforeStep` when the decision depends on the step number or previous step results. Resolves [#1363](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1363).
  - **`TurnConfig.output`** — new optional field on `TurnConfig` forwarded to `streamText`. Accepts the AI SDK's structured-output spec (e.g. `Output.object({ schema })`, `Output.text()`) so a single agent can keep tools enabled on intermediate turns and return schema-validated structured output on a designated turn — without losing tools at model construction. Combine with `activeTools: []` for providers that strip tools when `responseFormat: "json"` is active (e.g. `workers-ai-provider`). Resolves [#1383](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1383).
  - New re-exports from `@cloudflare/think`: `PrepareStepFunction`, `PrepareStepResult`, `PrepareStepContext`, `StepConfig`.

  `beforeStep` is available to subclasses; it is not dispatched to extensions (the AI SDK `prepareStep` boundary surfaces non-serializable inputs like `LanguageModel` instances). The AI SDK does not expose `output` or `maxSteps` per step — set those at the turn level via `TurnConfig`. All other extension hook subscriptions are unchanged.

- [#1372](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1372) [`040da0f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/040da0fae4bbbcc5d3f412f68441674e84207c8c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Remove Think's unused internal `session_id` config scaffolding and move Think's private config into a dedicated `think_config` table.

  Older builds wrote Think-owned config into Session's shared `assistant_config(session_id, key, value)` table even though Think never actually had top-level multi-session support and `_sessionId()` always returned the empty string. Think now stores its private config rows in `think_config(key, value)`, which better matches the shipped model of one Think Durable Object per conversation and avoids overloading Session's shared metadata table.

  Existing Durable Objects are migrated automatically on startup: legacy Think-owned keys stored in `assistant_config` with `session_id = ''` are copied into `think_config` before config reads and writes continue.

- [#1396](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1396) [`fdf5a8a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/fdf5a8a99ec1a88ce9096ddec3a9fb2adf6fd4b1) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix Think persisting a duplicate orphan assistant row when a user submits during a streaming tool turn ([#1381](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1381)).

  When `useAgentChat` posts an in-flight assistant snapshot it minted optimistically (client-generated ID, `state: "input-available"`), Session's INSERT-OR-IGNORE-by-ID would store it as a separate row alongside the eventual server-owned assistant for the same `toolCallId`. The next turn's `convertToModelMessages` then produced a malformed Anthropic prompt and the provider rejected it.

  `reconcileMessages` and `resolveToolMergeId` now live in `agents/chat` and Think runs them in `_handleChatRequest` before persistence. Stale `input-available` snapshots pick up the server's tool output via `mergeServerToolOutputs`, and any incoming assistant whose `toolCallId` already exists on a server row adopts the server's ID so persistence updates the existing row instead of inserting an orphan.

  `@cloudflare/ai-chat` keeps its existing reconciler behavior; the only change is that it now imports `reconcileMessages` / `resolveToolMergeId` from `agents/chat` instead of a local file.

- [#1374](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1374) [`a6e22c3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a6e22c362668fc295208d0718eae4cf2aa3f792a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix stream resumption on page refresh: do not broadcast `cf_agent_chat_messages` from Think's `onConnect` while a resumable stream is in flight.

  Previously, Think unconditionally sent a `cf_agent_chat_messages` frame on every new WebSocket connection. When a client refreshed during an active chat turn, that broadcast arrived in the same connect sequence as `cf_agent_stream_resuming` and overwrote the in-progress assistant message the client was about to rebuild from the resumed stream. The assistant reply would stay hidden until the server finished the turn and re-broadcast the persisted history.

  Now Think only broadcasts `cf_agent_chat_messages` on connect when there is no active resumable stream. During an active stream the resume flow is the authoritative source of state: `STREAM_RESUMING` triggers replay of buffered chunks, and the final state broadcast happens when the turn completes. This matches the behavior that `AIChatAgent` already had.

  Marked the internal `_resumableStream` field as `protected` (previously `private`) so framework subclasses and focused tests can coordinate around the resume lifecycle.

- [#1384](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1384) [`a7059d4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a7059d4a5a1071a10c60be0e777968fc7ff5d36c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Introduce `WorkspaceLike` — type the `this.workspace` field as the minimum surface Think actually uses instead of the concrete `Workspace` class.

  `Think`'s `workspace` is now typed as `WorkspaceLike` (`Pick<Workspace, "readFile" | "writeFile" | "readDir" | "rm" | "glob" | "mkdir" | "stat">`) rather than `Workspace`. `createWorkspaceTools()` likewise accepts any `WorkspaceLike`. The default runtime value is unchanged — a full `Workspace` backed by the DO's SQLite — so the vast majority of consumers need no changes.

  This unlocks patterns like a shared workspace across multiple agents: a child agent can override `workspace` with a proxy that forwards each call to a parent DO via RPC, and the rest of Think's workspace-aware code (the builtin tools, lifecycle hooks) keeps working without cast gymnastics. See `examples/assistant` for the cross-chat shared workspace built on this.

  Consumers who use `createWorkspaceStateBackend(workspace)` from `@cloudflare/shell` (codemode's `state.*` API) still need a concrete `Workspace` — that helper reaches for more of the filesystem surface than `WorkspaceLike` covers.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1350](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1350) [`3a1140f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3a1140fa561fdff5d1925f0c2b3b7436af8b483f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Align `Think` generics with `Agent` / `AIChatAgent`.

  `Think` is now `Think<Env, State, Props>` and extends `Agent<Env, State, Props>`, so subclasses get properly typed `this.state`, `this.setState()`, `initialState`, and `this.ctx.props`. The previous `Config` class generic is removed.

  `configure()` and `getConfig()` remain, but the config type is now specified at the call site via a method-level generic:

  ```ts
  // Before
  export class MyAgent extends Think<Env, MyConfig> {
    getModel() {
      const tier = this.getConfig()?.modelTier ?? "fast";
      // ...
    }
  }

  // After
  export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
    getModel() {
      const tier = this.getConfig<MyConfig>()?.modelTier ?? "fast";
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

  This is a breaking change for anyone using the second type parameter of `Think`. Update the class declaration and any direct `configure(...)` / `getConfig()` call sites that relied on the class-level `Config` type.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1340](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1340) [`3cbe776`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3cbe77668df356906244db6a75c4cfba2daa1836) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Align Think lifecycle hooks with the AI SDK and fix latent bugs around tool-call hooks and extension dispatch.

  **Lifecycle hook context types are now derived from the AI SDK** (resolves [#1339](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1339)). `StepContext`, `ChunkContext`, `ToolCallContext`, and `ToolCallResultContext` are derived from `StepResult`, `TextStreamPart`, and `TypedToolCall` so users get full typed access to `reasoning`, `sources`, `files`, `providerMetadata` (where Anthropic cache tokens live), `request`/`response`, etc., instead of `unknown`. The relevant AI SDK types are re-exported from `@cloudflare/think`.

  **`beforeToolCall` / `afterToolCall` now fire with correct timing.** `beforeToolCall` runs **before** the tool's `execute` (Think wraps every tool's `execute`), and `afterToolCall` runs **after** with `durationMs` and a discriminated `success`/`output`/`error` outcome (backed by `experimental_onToolCallFinish`).

  **`ToolCallDecision` is now functional.** Returning `{ action: "block", reason }`, `{ action: "substitute", output }`, or `{ action: "allow", input }` from `beforeToolCall` actually intercepts execution.

  **Extension hook dispatch.** `ExtensionManifest.hooks` claimed support for `beforeToolCall`/`afterToolCall`/`onStepFinish`/`onChunk` but Think only ever dispatched `beforeTurn`. All five hooks now dispatch to subscribed extensions with JSON-safe snapshots. Extension hook handlers also receive `(snapshot, host)` (symmetric with tool `execute`); previously only tool executes got the host bridge.

  **Breaking renames** (per AI SDK conventions): `ToolCallContext.args` → `input`, `ToolCallResultContext.args` → `input`, `ToolCallResultContext.result` → `output`. `afterToolCall` is now a discriminated union — read `output` only when `ctx.success === true`, and `error` when `ctx.success === false`. Equivalent renames on `ToolCallDecision`.

  See [docs/think/lifecycle-hooks.md](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/think/lifecycle-hooks.md) for the full hook reference.

### Patch Changes

- [#1340](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1340) [`3cbe776`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/3cbe77668df356906244db6a75c4cfba2daa1836) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `_wrapToolsWithDecision` to `await originalExecute(...)` before checking for `Symbol.asyncIterator`. The previous code missed `Promise<AsyncIterable>` returns from plain async functions (`async function execute(...) { return makeIter(); }`) — `Symbol.asyncIterator in promise` is always false, the collapse logic was skipped, and the AI SDK ended up treating the iterator instance itself as the final output value (which the wrapper's own comment warned about). Both sync-returned-iterable and async-returned-iterable cases are now covered, with regression tests for each.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1330](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1330) [`b4d3fcf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b4d3fcfcce7363b137ad47c31d40aebcb34d9a28) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `subAgent()` cross-DO I/O errors on first use and drop the `"experimental"` compatibility flag requirement.

  ### `subAgent()` cross-DO I/O fix

  Three issues in the facet initialization path caused `"Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different Durable Object"` errors when spawning sub-agents in production:

  - `subAgent()` constructed a `Request` in the parent DO and passed it to the child via `stub.fetch()`. The `Request` carried native I/O tied to the parent isolate, which the child rejected.
  - The facet flag was set _after_ the first `onStart()` ran, so `broadcastMcpServers()` fired with `_isFacet === false` on the initial boot.
  - `_broadcastProtocol()`, the inherited `broadcast()`, and `_workflow_broadcast()` iterated the connection registry without an `_isFacet` guard, letting broadcasts reach into the parent DO's WebSocket registry from a child isolate.

  Replaces the fetch-based handshake with a new `_cf_initAsFacet(name)` RPC that runs entirely in the child isolate, sets `_isFacet` before init, and seeds partyserver's `__ps_name` key directly. Adds `_isFacet` guards to `_broadcastProtocol()` and overrides `broadcast()` to no-op on facets so downstream callers (chat-streaming paths, workflow broadcasts, user `this.broadcast(...)`) are covered. Removes the previous internal `_cf_markAsFacet()` method — `_cf_initAsFacet(name)` is the correct entry point (it sets the flag before running the first `onStart()`, which `_cf_markAsFacet` did not).

  ### `"experimental"` compatibility flag no longer required

  `ctx.facets`, `ctx.exports`, and `env.LOADER` (Worker Loader) have graduated out of the `"experimental"` compatibility flag in workerd. `agents` and `@cloudflare/think` no longer require it:

  - `subAgent()` / `abortSubAgent()` / `deleteSubAgent()` — the `@experimental` JSDoc tag and runtime error messages no longer reference the flag. The runtime guards on `ctx.facets` / `ctx.exports` stay in place and now nudge users toward updating `compatibility_date` instead.
  - `Think` — the `@experimental` JSDoc tag no longer references the flag.

  No code change is required; remove `"experimental"` from your `compatibility_flags` in `wrangler.jsonc` if it was only there for these features.

- [#1332](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1332) [`7cb8acf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7cb8acff8281a30bc17980e506ab5582f3cb1c72) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Expose `createdAt` on fiber and chat recovery contexts so apps can suppress continuations for stale, interrupted turns.

  - `FiberRecoveryContext` (from `agents`) gains `createdAt: number` — epoch milliseconds when `runFiber` started, read from the `cf_agents_runs` row that was already tracked internally.
  - `ChatRecoveryContext` (from `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think`) gains the same `createdAt` field, threaded through from the underlying fiber.

  With this, the stale-recovery guard pattern described in [#1324](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1324) is a short override:

  ```typescript
  override async onChatRecovery(ctx: ChatRecoveryContext): Promise<ChatRecoveryOptions> {
    if (Date.now() - ctx.createdAt > 2 * 60 * 1000) return { continue: false };
    return {};
  }
  ```

  No behavior change for existing callers. See `docs/agents/chat-agents.md` (new "Guarding against stale recoveries" section) for the full recipe, including a loop-protection pattern using `onChatResponse`.

  The config storage helpers (`getConfig`, `configure`) now lazily ensure the `assistant_config` table exists before querying it, so they are safe to call at any point in the agent lifecycle — including during `configureSession()`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1275](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1275) [`37b2ce3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/37b2ce37913566ce81d30377d5cb5b224765a3f3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add built-in workspace to Think. Every Think instance now has `this.workspace` backed by the DO's SQLite storage, and workspace tools (read, write, edit, list, find, grep, delete) are automatically merged into every chat turn. Override `workspace` to add R2 spillover for large files. `@cloudflare/shell` is now a required peer dependency.

- [#1278](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1278) [`8c7caab`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/8c7caabb68361c8ce71b10e292d6dd33a9cc72dd) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Think now owns the inference loop with lifecycle hooks at every stage.

  **Breaking:** `onChatMessage()`, `assembleContext()`, and `getMaxSteps()` are removed. Use lifecycle hooks and the `maxSteps` property instead. If you need full custom inference, extend `Agent` directly.

  **New lifecycle hooks:** `beforeTurn`, `beforeToolCall`, `afterToolCall`, `onStepFinish`, `onChunk` — fire on every turn from all entry paths (WebSocket, `chat()`, `saveMessages`, auto-continuation).

  **`beforeTurn(ctx)`** receives the assembled system prompt, messages, tools, and model. Return a `TurnConfig` to override any part — model, system prompt, messages, tools, activeTools, toolChoice, maxSteps, providerOptions.

  **`maxSteps`** is now a property (default 10) instead of a method. Override per-turn via `TurnConfig.maxSteps`.

  **MCP tools auto-merged** — no need to manually merge `this.mcp.getAITools()` in `getTools()`.

  **Dynamic context blocks:** `Session.addContext()` and `Session.removeContext()` allow adding/removing context blocks after session initialization (e.g., from extensions).

  **Extension manifest expanded** with `context` (namespaced context block declarations) and `hooks` fields.

  **Think (`@cloudflare/think`):**

  - Session integration: `this.messages` backed by `session.getHistory()`, tree-structured messages, context blocks, compaction, FTS5 search
  - `configureSession()` override for context blocks, compaction, search, skills (sync or async)
  - `assembleContext()` returns `{ system, messages }` with context block composition
  - `onChatResponse()` lifecycle hook fires from all turn paths
  - Non-destructive regeneration via `trigger: "regenerate-message"` with Session branching
  - `saveMessages()` for programmatic turn entry (scheduled responses, webhooks, proactive agents)
  - `continueLastTurn()` for extending the last assistant response
  - Custom body persistence across hibernation
  - `sanitizeMessageForPersistence()` hook for PII redaction
  - `messageConcurrency` strategies (queue/latest/merge/drop/debounce)
  - `resetTurnState()` extracted as protected method
  - `chatRecovery` with `runFiber` wrapping on all 4 turn paths
  - `onChatRecovery()` hook with `ChatRecoveryContext`
  - `hasPendingInteraction()` / `waitUntilStable()` for quiescence detection
  - Re-export `Session` from `@cloudflare/think`
  - Constructor wraps `onStart` — subclasses never need `super.onStart()`

  **agents (`agents/chat`):**

  - Extract `AbortRegistry`, `applyToolUpdate` + builders, `parseProtocolMessage` into shared `agents/chat` layer
  - Add `applyChunkToParts` export for fiber recovery

  **AIChatAgent (`@cloudflare/ai-chat`):**

  - Refactor to use shared `AbortRegistry` from `agents/chat`
  - Add `continuation` flag to `OnChatMessageOptions`
  - Export `getAgentMessages()` and tool part helpers
  - Add `getHttpUrl()` to `useAgent` return value

- [#1256](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1256) [`dfab937`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/dfab937c81b358415e66bda3f8abe76b85d12c11) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add durable fiber execution to the Agent base class.

  `runFiber(name, fn)` registers work in SQLite, holds a `keepAlive` ref, and enables recovery via `onFiberRecovered` after DO eviction. `ctx.stash()` and `this.stash()` checkpoint progress that survives eviction.

  `AIChatAgent` gains `chatRecovery` — when enabled, each chat turn is wrapped in a fiber. `onChatRecovery` provides provider-specific recovery (Workers AI continuation, OpenAI response retrieval, Anthropic synthetic message). `continueLastTurn()` appends to the interrupted assistant message seamlessly.

  `Think` now extends `Agent` directly (no mixin). Fiber support is inherited from the base class.

  **Breaking (experimental APIs only):**

  - Removed `withFibers` mixin (`agents/experimental/forever`)
  - Removed `withDurableChat` mixin (`@cloudflare/ai-chat/experimental/forever`)
  - Removed `./experimental/forever` export from both packages
  - Think no longer has a `fibers` flag — recovery is automatic via alarm housekeeping

AIChatAgent's 15 internal auto-continuation fields consolidated into one `ContinuationState` instance (no public API change). Think gains deferred continuations, resume coordination for pending continuations, `onClose` cleanup, and hibernation persistence for client tools via `think_request_context` table.

  generation-based invalidation for chat turn scheduling. AIChatAgent and
  Think now both use `TurnQueue` internally, unifying turn serialization
  and the epoch/clear-generation concept. Think gains proper turn
  serialization (previously concurrent chat turns could interleave).

- [#1220](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1220) [`31d96cb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/31d96cb10ab1c8cbd9fd96b73d82ef55c5524138) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Fix `@cloudflare/shell` peer dependency to require `>=0.2.0`. Previously, npm could resolve an incompatible shell version, causing runtime errors. If you hit `Workspace` constructor errors, upgrade `@cloudflare/shell` to 0.2.0 or later.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1138](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1138) [`36e2020`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/36e2020d41d3d8a83b65b7e45e5af924b09f82ed) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Drop Zod v3 from peer dependency range — now requires `zod ^4.0.0`. Replace dynamic `import("ai")` with `z.fromJSONSchema()` from Zod 4 for MCP tool schema conversion, removing the `ai` runtime dependency from the agents core. Remove `ensureJsonSchema()`.
