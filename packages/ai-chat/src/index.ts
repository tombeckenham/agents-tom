// while a slower sibling is still `input-available` — that feeds the provider
// an incomplete tool-result set. The barrier is event-driven (converged onto
// `@cloudflare/think`'s model): we only fire the continuation once the leaf
// step's batch is fully answered, re-arming on each applied result and on stream
// finalize, with NO orphan timeout — an incomplete batch simply never
// auto-continues until it completes (a later user turn / chat recovery repairs
// the transcript). See design/rfc-chat-recovery-foundation.md.
// (Stable-state retry delay `CHAT_RECOVERY_STABLE_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` now lives
// in agents/chat; the reschedule that consumes it is owned by the shared engine.
// The recovering-flag key/TTL and the terminal-record key now live in agents/chat

// sweep via the shared `sweepStaleChatRecoveryIncidents` helper.)

   * When this facet runs as an agent-tool child and its turn is interrupted, the
   * recovery continuation (`continueLastTurn` / `_retryLastUserTurn`) mints a NEW
   * request id but never flows through `startAgentToolRun`'s
   * `_registerAgentToolTurn`. So `cf_ai_chat_agent_tool_runs.request_id` (and the
   * in-memory attribution map) still point at the pre-eviction turn, and
   * `broadcast` can no longer attribute the recovered turn's frames to the run.
   * A long-running child then forwards nothing to the parent's re-attach tail,
   * its no-progress budget elapses, and a healthy child is abandoned as
   * `interrupted`. Re-binding keeps attribution alive across recovery.
   *
   * Safe to call on EVERY recovery continuation:
   *   - Facets that never ran as an agent-tool child have no
   *     `cf_ai_chat_agent_tool_runs` table → the guarded SELECT throws → no-op.
   *   - A facet whose run already settled has no active row → no-op.
   *   - A child DO is addressed by its `runId` (`subAgent(cls, runId)`), so it
   *     owns AT MOST ONE child-run row for its whole lifetime and is never reused
   *     as a top-level chat agent — the single active row is unambiguously this
   *     recovery's run. The `order by started_at desc limit 1` is defensive
   *     belt-and-suspenders for that invariant.
   *
   * Uses the same `status in ('starting','running')` active-run predicate as
   * `_agentToolRunForRequest` and the `@cloudflare/think` counterpart.

   *    200KB+ payloads in `input` and `output`. These are truncated since the
   *    model has already consumed the results.
   *
   * 3. **Filter truly empty reasoning parts**: After stripping, reasoning parts
   *    with no text and no remaining providerMetadata are removed. Parts that
   *    still carry providerMetadata (e.g. Anthropic's redacted_thinking blocks
   *    with providerMetadata.anthropic.redactedData) are preserved, as they
   *    contain data required for round-tripping with the provider API.
